He had some initial shaky performances, Davie Adams but did soon settle in and become respected as one of the better goalkeepers in the Scottish League. <br><br>His first major match was the Scottish Cup final of 1904. Rangers were actually leading two nil early on, with Davie Adams actually responsible for both goals. However, the might Jimmy Quinn famously scored a hat-trick and Adams recovered to not put a foot wrong thereafter. Things never looked back thereafter.<br><br>Jimmy Quinn said of him that Davie Adams didn&#39;t &quot;<i>come out of his shell</i>&quot; until a great 2-1 win over Rangers in the Glasgow Cup (8 Oct 1904). Something thereafter we were to benefit from.<br><br>At the beginning of the 1906/07 campaign, Davie Adams suffered a badly cut hand playing in a benefit game at Ibrox for Rangers star Finlay Speedie. The mishap was caused through a nail which had been inserted in a goalpost for a five-a-side tournament during a sports meeting and had not been removed. Adams, in making a save, lacerated his hand. Rangers kindly loaned the Celts their reserve Tom Sinclair in the meantime. <br><br>A notable match of his was in the Glasgow Cup final of Oct 1907, when he was said to have played virtually on his own throughout the second half. Celtic went on to win 2-1 v Rangers in the match. <br><br>In truth, he had the problem of the odd blunder but was found to learn from them. So any errors just made him stronger. As much as goalkeepers had to do a little &quot;<i>playing out</i>&quot;, he was said to have excelled in those skills. <br><br>Davie Adams loved repartee and on one memorable occasion when MacLeod was bitching on to him after conceding a soft goal, Davie Adams began to get irritated as the full-back kept going on about the mistake:<br><blockquote>  <i>MacLeod: &lsquo;How the hell did you lose that ball?&rsquo; </i><br><i>Adams: &lsquo;Shut up! I know where the ball is. I havnae lost it<b>. </b>It&rsquo;s in the net!&rsquo; </i><br></blockquote><br>Curiously, his only spell out the side came from a frustrating injury, where during a benefit friendly match in the summer of 1906, he cut his hand on a nail sticking out a post. It cost him a Glasgow Cup medal. <br><br>His swansong was the <a href="/page/1911" target="_self">1911</a> <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup" target="_self">Scottish Cup</a>, which Celtic lifted without conceding a goal throughout the competition. He continued to play on till December of that year, but eye trouble forced his retirement a few months later. He was also allegedly a &quot;martyr to rheumatism&quot;. His last game was also Patsy Gallagher&#39;s debut, so as one great left the club another moved in. <br><br>He was a very reliable keeper, and his record of silverware proves the point, with a distinguished shut-out rate of 43% in the league &amp; Scottish Cup. <br><br>He went on to win numerous club honours, including six successive League Championship medals and four Scottish Cup medals, an enviable record for any period. <br><br>Disappointingly, he never received recognition at full international level. One explanation offered was that the defensive players immediately in front of him at Celtic were so secure that he was seldom called into action; and, indeed, Davie Adams often complained of getting cold through inactivity behind such a well-drilled defence. <br><br>Big Davie Adams was the last Celtic &lsquo;keeper to appear in the hoops and the first to wear a distinguishable yellow jersey to represent the goalkeeper. <br><br>The support loved him and showed this when he appeared from the pavilion unannounced to run the line for Celtic versus Barnsley (3rd Sep 1912).<br><br>Davie Adams after retiring ran a pub in East Kilbride then later moved to Tranent and ran a pub called the plough. He had 3 children Charlie, Lisa and Janet.<br><br>He died in a nursing home in Edinburgh on 29 November 1948, aged sixty-five.<br><br>A great goalkeeper, overshadowed by the earlier Dan McArthur and the later Charlie Shaw. However, Davie Adam&#39;s record shows he deserves greater recognition on his own too.
