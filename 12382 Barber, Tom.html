Quite a capture as he was a goal scorer in the FA Cup final for Aston Villa v Sunderland.<br><br>When the war broke out he joined the Footballers Battalion but leg wounds on the war front (on the &#39;Western Front&#39;) led to his lay up in Aberdeen Infirmary. Despite fears, he recovered to play for England v Scotland in the Haig Hospital Fund International at Celtic Park on June 8th 1918 (but no caps appear to have been awarded for this game).<br><br>Working in munitions in Glasgow, the Derby-born player stayed just one season at <a href="/page/Celtic+Park" target="_self">Celtic Park</a> after failing to secure a regular start in a side which went on to claim the league title. He went down with pleurisy in Sep 1918 but recovered.<br><br> After just five league appearances for Celtic, Barber moved across Glasgow to Partick Thistle. <br><br>Interestingly, he also played for Belfast Celtic in January 1919 (a loan signing). This is a very notable point as this came at around the time of the troubles in Ireland (War of Independence) and <a href="/page/Belfast+Celtic" target="_self">Belfast Celtic</a> supporters were likely very identified with the Irish Republican side. This must be noted with respect to that Tom Barber was English and an ex-soldier. Amazingly, he also had a loan spell with Linfield at a similar time in January 1919 (their support is identified with the British Unionist side). Quite a feat for Tom and at what a time. Must have had some stories to tell.<br><br>It reflects both Celtic &amp; <a href="/page/Belfast+Celtic" target="_self">Belfast Celtic</a> in a good light that despite the situation (i.e. socially  &amp; politically) that both clubs would still employ and play a man with his  background regardless of anything else. <br><br>He retired from football in 1925, after shuffling between a number of clubs. <br><br>Sadly, illness and injury hampered Tom Barber&#39;s life even after football.  He was struck down with tuberculosis which led to his premature death in the same year as he stopped playing football, aged just 37. Too young an age for any man.<br><br>An interesting character who walked into the world of a set of clubs at a uniquely pivotal point in the history of their supporters&#39; lives.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career<br></h3><div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  1918-19</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  5</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  5</td></tr><tr><td width="16%">Goals: </td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Honours with Celtic</h3><b>Scottish League</b><ul><li><font size="2"><a href="/page/1919" target="_self">1918-19</a></font></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Pictures</h3>  <ul><li>  <a href="/page/Barber%2C+Tom+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul><h3>Links</h3><ul><li><a href="/page/Belfast+Celtic" target="_self">Belfast Celtic</a></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Articles</h3><h3>Tommy Barber</h3>Source: http://www.footballandthefirstworldwar.com/tom-barber/<br><br>Thomas Barber (1888-1925) was born on 20 February 1888 in West Stanley and died in Nuneaton on 18 September 1925.
