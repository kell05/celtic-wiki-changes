Jozo Simunovic found himself on the wrong side of Brophy as the Kilmarnock striker bustled his way into the area, going down under a clumsy challenge from the big defender.<br><br>Referee Kevin Clancy had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and even penalty specialist Fraser Forster was powerless to keep out Brophy&rsquo;s thunderous strike.<br><br>Celtic were jolted into a more accustomed style of play as they upped the tempo and set about camping themselves inside the Kilmarnock half.<br><br>Griffiths dragged a shot well wide after good build up work from Edouard and Tom Rogic, then as the pressure intensified Kilmarnock goalkeeper Laurentiu Branescu got down to his left to hold a 20 yard effort from Rogic.<br><br>As the visitors struggled to get out of their own defensive third, Branescu preserved their lead with a smart save from Griffiths, although it was a premium chance the Celtic striker would have expected to finish off.<br>Simunovic then almost spectacularly atoned for his part in Kilmarnock&rsquo;s goal when he joined the attack and unleashed a wickedly dipping shot from around 30 yards which Branescu did well to touch over.<br><br>It seemed inevitable that Celtic&rsquo;s incessant pressure would pay off and so it proved as they turned the match around with two goals in the space of four minutes. The 29th minute equaliser came when Kilmarnock were unable to clear a corner from the left, the ball knocked back across the six yard box by Christopher Jullien for Ajer to force home a shot with the aid of a deflection off Niko Hamalainen.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s second goal was similar in its build-up and execution. This time, Greg Taylor&rsquo;s cross from the left was headed back into the six yard box by Simunovic, presenting Edouard with a chance which he bundled in with the ball ricocheting off Kirk Broadfoot on its way into the net.<br><br>There was never any likelihood of Celtic relinquishing the control they had now taken on proceedings and any prospect of Kilmarnock finding a response effectively evaporated when Power was dismissed 12 minutes into the second half.<br><br>The combative midfielder had already been booked in first half stoppage time for a foul on Ryan Christie and referee Clancy deemed his challenge on Jeremie Frimpong, who was injured in a clash with the Irish midfielder last month, as worthy of a second yellow card.<br><br>Mercifully for Kilmarnock, they were spared from being on the end of what could easily have been a rout as Celtic were wasteful in front of goal. They had to settle for adding just one more to their tally, Griffiths tapping in from close range after Edouard and Christie had combined superbly on the left to carve open the overstretched Killie defence.<br><br>The afternoon ended with brothers on rival teams as Ally Taylor, younger sibling of Celtic full-back Greg, made his debut for a Killie side whose hopes of a top six finish may be slipping away  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div></div><div><h3>  BBC</h3><br><br>By Martin Dowden<br><br>BBC Scotland at Celtic Park<br><br> 4 hours ago From the section Scottish Premiership <br><br>Leigh Griffiths scores Celtic third goal<br>Leigh Griffiths scores Celtic third goal - his fifth in eight games<br><br>Celtic recovered from losing an early Kilmarnock goal to win handsomely and march 12 points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership.<br><br>With Rangers drawing at St Johnstone, Neil Lennon&#39;s men took advantage as they bid to win a ninth title in a row.<br><br>Eamonn Brophy&#39;s penalty had initially rocked Celtic but Kristoffer Ajer and Odsonne Edouard had the hosts ahead.<br><br>Leigh Griffiths added a third shortly after Kilmarnock were reduced to 10 men following Alan Power&#39;s second yellow.<br><br>The champions have now won 15 of their last 16 home games, with 32 goals scored since the winter break.<br><br>For Kilmarnock it was a third defeat in a row and leaves them five points off a place in the top six.<br><br> Increased lead &#39;icing on cake&#39; for Celtic<br> Reaction &amp; how it happened<br><br>Are Celtic now unstoppable?<br><br>Celtic did what champions do. They had the opportunity to extend their lead in the table and continued their relentless and now seemingly inevitable march to the title.<br><br>That happened despite an early setback. Kilmarnock started brightly and forced early corners with Nicke Kabamba going close but his shot was blocked. However, their persistence paid off.<br><br>Jozo Simunovic dived in rashly but didn&#39;t win the ball cleanly. His attempts to recover resulted in Brophy being impeded inside the area and the Scotland forward tucked away the spot-kick impressively.<br><br>As that goal went in, St Johnstone scored against Rangers in Perth to ease the pain for Celtic fans - and soon things got even better.<br><br>Alex Dyer&#39;s side dropped very deep and ultimately could not hold out. They had no out ball and Celtic forced the issue.<br><br>Griffiths was denied after superb build up by Edouard. Simunovic then sent in a deflected effort that was tipped over by Laurentiu Branescu.<br><br>Any resistance appeared unlikely to last and was pierced when Christopher Jullien scrambled the ball back into danger from a corner and Ajer bundled home.<br>Tom Rogiv, Odsonne Edouard and Jozo Simunovic<br><br>Kilmarnock&#39;s approach increasingly allowed Celtic defenders to step out as they had little to contend with. It proved key as Simunovic nodded Greg Taylor&#39;s cross back to Edouard, who outmuscled Kirk Broadfoot to net the second.<br><br>The second half was a procession towards Kilmarnock&#39;s goal as Celtic searched for the crucial third.<br><br>That task became more straightforward when Power received a second yellow after tackling Jeremie Frimpong. It seemed rather harsh as the young Celtic wing-back seemed to have lost control of the ball.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, the third goal arrived. An incisive move down the left released Ryan Christie to the bye-line and he pulled the ball across for Griffiths to tap home.<br><br>Brilliant play looked to have created a fourth but Griffiths&#39;s strike was ruled offside, before he was then superbly denied by Branescu as time ticked on.<br><br>Celtic are flying and with a 12-point lead in the title race it feels like a huge task for Rangers to reel them in from here.<br>Man of the match - Odsonne Edouard<br><br>The young French striker is a class act and seems to thrive alongside Griffiths. Celtic fans will be desperate to retain him beyond the summer as he has everything.<br><br>His goal return is strong but it&#39;s Edouard&#39;s ability to be calm, to bring others into play that&#39;s equally impressive. He is strong, always in full control of the ball, and more often than not picks the right option. He is an absolute nightmare for any defender and when you consider his youth, he has room to get better.<br><br>He netted again today and produced another impressive display that went a long way to delivering another league win.<br>&#39;I thought we were outstanding&#39; - reaction<br>&#39;It&#39;s the hardest thing in football&#39; - Lennon on Celtic&#39;s winning run<br><br>Celtic manager Neil Lennon: &quot;I thought Eamonn [Brophy] was offside, but our reaction to that was fantastic. It was a real magnificent performance. I thought we were outstanding.<br><br>&quot;To be fair to Alex Dyer, he went with two strikers. But we dealt with that very well. I said to the players &#39;don&#39;t think it&#39;s easy what you&#39;re doing&#39;. It&#39;s important we keep the momentum going.&quot;<br><br>Kilmarnock manager Alex Dyer: &quot;We were doing alright - I thought we were in control. Then they started to play a bit, put us under pressure. We were sloppy for the goals, and scored maybe too early.<br><br>&quot;The gameplan was to win the game, or at least get a point, but we came up against a side in really good form. I&#39;m still happy with my boys - they worked hard and gave it all they&#39;ve got after a hard week.&quot;  </div><div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Match ends, Celtic 3, Kilmarnock 1.</div></div></div><div class="gs-o-media__body"><h3 class="lx-stream-post__header-title gel-great-primer-bold">Full Time</h3></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+4&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Second Half ends, Celtic 3, Kilmarnock 1.</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+3&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Mohamed Elyounoussi (Celtic) wins a free kick in the defensive half.</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+3&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Foul by Kirk Broadfoot (Kilmarnock).</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Attempt saved.
