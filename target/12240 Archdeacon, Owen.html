    <br>
    The Greenock-born youngster was a talented and entertaining wideman who had starred for Scotland at youth level and had been named Scotland Youth Player of the Year in 1984. Hopes were high that Owen would be able to transfer his ability to the highest level and he certainly made a good first impression when he came off the bench to score on his debut in the last minute as Celtic defeated <a href="/page/Motherwell" target="_self">Motherwell</a> 4-2 at <a href="/page/Celtic+Park" target="_self">Parkhead</a> on 10 April 1984. He was the first Celtic player to score on his competitive debut for 13 years.<br>
    <br>
    Owen really came into his own during the 1985/86 season which culminated in winning the league on the last day of the season in a 5-0 win against St Mirren at Celtic Park. With the combination of Tommy Burns behind him (Davie Hay&#39;s new left back) and Archdeacon as a wide man, a fast counter-attacking option became available on the left side and was one of the keys to the increasing quality and success as the season wore on. Archdeacon could also deliver a wicked corner too.<br>
    <br>
    However, despite his undoubted skill on the ball Archdeacon struggled to perform consistently for the first team and despite some excellent performances he never really commanded a regular first team spot.<br>
    <br>
    He departed Parkhead in June <a href="/page/1989" target="_self">1989</a> for Barnsley after 87 senior appearances for the Hoops and 8 goals.<br>
    <br>
    Whilst at Celtic he made a single appearance for the Scotland under-21 team in a game in 1987 against West Germany.<br>
    <br>
    In June 1989 he moved to Barnsley for &pound;80,000 and became a fixture for the Yorkshire club in the following seasons. He left the club in 1996 to join Carlisle United and was a regular member of the team during a season and a half there. Late in 1997 former Celtic team-mate Billy Stark paid &pound;100,000 to take him to Morton and Archdeacon played for his hometown side until his playing retirement in 1999.<br>
    <br>
    Since then Archdeacon has turned out for the Celtic legends team.<br>
    <br>
    Owen worked for a time as a Youth Team coach with Celtic and at time of writing works with the U13&#39;s at the Academy.<br>
    <br>
    Football was in the family blood. Owen&#39;s father - also Owen Archdeacon - was also a left-sided professional footballer who had games for St Mirren in the 50&#39;s, and his son had spells with sides including Clyde and Motherwell.<br>
