    The green collar, white shirt, green sleeves change kit was worn (usually against Kilmarnock at home) until the Scottish Cup quarter-final v Killie at Celtic Park on March 6th, 1965. I think this was the last time we wore it. <br>

    We started wearing the all-green change kit earlier in season 1964-65, and in fact wore the all-green in the previous round of that season&#39;s cup, a 1-0 win over Queen&#39;s Park at Hampden. The old style dark green &amp; white hooped socks were worn for the last time at the Scottish Cup final v Dunfermline on 24th April 1965.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We continued to wear the all-green until 1967-68, when some small but very smart changes were made, viz, jersey became all-green (a slightly darker shade, sort of forest green, with no white collar &amp; cuffs as previously), white shorts were occasionally worn, and two thin white bands were introduced at the top of the stockings. This kit was used till 1972-73<br>

    <br>
    In 1968-69, we introduced an all-white kit with thin green trim at collars and cuffs - this was worn (not sure if it was the first time) against St Etienne on 2nd October, 1968 in the EC 1st Round, 2nd leg at Celtic Park, whenb we famously overhauled a 2-0 away leg deficit to win 4-0 on the night.<br>

    The black &amp; green Inter Milan was introduced in the 1970&#39;s (not sure if it was 1971-72 , or perhaps 1973 or 74).<br>

      <br>
      <br>
    </b>In <b>1972-73</b>, an all-yellow change kit was introduced. The first time I recall seeing it was in a 1-1 league draw with Hibs at CP on 23rd Dec 1972. Jock Stein said at the time that he thought there was &quot;too much green&quot; in these games!<br>
