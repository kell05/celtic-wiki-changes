    <b>PARKING:</b> Parking next to the beach is quite popular!<br>
    <br>
    <b>WHAT TO EXPECT</b><br>
    <br>
    The possibilty of getting wet. One part of the south stand is not covered by a roof. Nice if its a warm sunny day, but being that close to the North Sea its rarely warm. And we have a habit of being sent there in the middle of winter.<br>
    <br>
    Granite everywhere. A more grey looking city you&#39;ll do well to find.<br>
    <br>
    Despite the rumours, I&#39;ve yet to see a sheep. Take what you want from that.<br>
    <br>
    <b>SAD TRIVIA</b><br>
    <br>
    Aberdeen were founded in 1903 as a merger of three local clubs - Aberdeen, Victoria United, and Orion.<br>
    <br>
    When Aberdeen joined the first division in 1905-06, they stayed in Scotland&#39;s top flight. They are the only team outside the Old Firm to have done that for any length of time (you could technically count Caley Thistle as a fourth team never to have been relegated from Scotland&#39;s top division)<br>
    <br>
    Aberdeen initally played in all white, but on joining the league they changed to black and gold, giving them the nickname the wasps. They red shirts followed in 1939, and they finally went to their more famous all red in 1965.<br>
    <br>
    Aberdeen&#39;s greatest triumph came in 1983 when they won the European Cup Winners Cup. Unlike Rangers, Aberdeen had won the Scottish Cup in 1982 during a time where they were known as the New Firm, along with Dundee United. Aberdeen also won the Super Cup in 1983. That team included current Aberdeen General Manager Willie Miller, former Rangers manager Alex McLeish, and of course current Celtic manager Gordon Strachan. All under the management of current Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.<br>
    <br>
    Sadly, Aberdeen could have stopped the rubbish nine-in-a-row of Rangers, as they went into the final game of the 1990-91 season sitting above Rangers on goal difference. But a 2-0 win for Rangers against Aberdeen gave them that 3rd title. This was the last time Aberdeen would finish so high in Scotland&#39;s top division.<br>
    <br>
    Aberdeen actually avoided relegation to the first division in 2000 when Falkirk were supposed to be promoted but missed out due to a substandard stadium.<br>
    <br>
    <b>TIM FRIENDLY PUBS</b><br>
    <br>
    Gilcomston Bar, known as the &quot;Gilpie&quot; which is home to the Grampian Emerald CSC. Occasionally you will find pre and post match entertainment in there by the way of Live Music. The address is 5 Gilcomston Steps.<br>
    It has been known for the Grampian Emerald to provide a Double Decker bus for fans to get to the stadium from the Gilpie, takes about 5-10 mins by bus and it will take a good 20 minutes to walk it.<br>
    <br>
    Another is The Regent Bar on Regents Quay along the harbour front. Frankie who runs the bar is a keen fan and this pub is jam packed full of tims prior to the games at Pittodrie. It is about a 15 minute walk from this pub to the stadium.<br>
    <br>
    <b>PUBS TO AVOID</b><br>
    <br>
    Northern Bar on George Street which is home to an inferior teams supporters club<br>
