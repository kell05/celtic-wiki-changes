    After a win v the Huns in Apr 08 (<a href="/page/2008-04-27%3A+Celtic+3-2+Rangers%2C+Premier+League" target="_self"><font color="#800080">Match Page</font></a>), a 3-2 win, Boruc put on a t-shirt with the Pope&#39;s face on it in front of the Celtic fans. Huns being huns, ended up making a daft hoo-haa about with the below classics! You got to love Boruc, he knows how to rile up the Huns big time!!!<br>

    <div class="TailParas">  <b>MP REGRETS GOALKEEPER&rsquo;S &rsquo;POPE&rsquo; T-SHIRT</b><br>
      By Ben Padley, PA Political Staff</div>
      
    <div class="TailParas">  <br>
      An MP today said he &ldquo;deeply regretted&rdquo; the actions of Celtic goalkeeper Artur<br>
      Boruc who wore a T-shirt with the inscription &ldquo;God Bless The Pope&rdquo; at the<br>
      latest Old Firm game.</div>
      
    <div class="TailParas">  <br>
      The DUP&rsquo;s Gregory Campbell (E Londonderry) criticised the player for revealing<br>
      the design worn under his club shirt following Celtic&rsquo;s 3-2 win over Rangers on<br>
      Sunday.</div>
      
    <div class="TailParas">  <br>
      He said he was &ldquo;saddened&rdquo; that the gesture - which he said had no place in<br>
      football - had not been punished by Celtic FC.</div>
      
    <div class="TailParas">  <br>
      Mr Campbell has tabled a Commons motion calling for the club to oppose actions<br>
      &ldquo;that could serve to heighten tension between players as well as supporters.&rdquo;</div>
      
    <div class="TailParas">  <br>
      Following the incident, Celtic manager Gordon Strachan said: &ldquo;If it was &rsquo;God<br>
      bless Myra Hindley&rsquo;, I might have a problem.&rdquo;</div>
      
    <div class="TailParas">  <br>
      Mr Boruc, who fans have nicknamed the &ldquo;Holy Goalie&rdquo; will not face censure by<br>
      the Scottish Football Association, a spokesman said today.</div>
      
    <div class="TailParas">  <br>
      The spokesman confirmed that referee Craig Thomson did not include any mention<br>
      of the post-match incident in his report.</div>
      
    <div class="TailParas">  <br>
      The Pole has been no stranger to controversy during his time at Celtic Park. In<br>
      August 2006 he received a procurator fiscal&rsquo;s caution for breach of the peace<br>
      after making gestures at Rangers fans at Ibrox in February that year.</div>
      
    <div class="TailParas">  <br>
      Boruc caused a stir at the end of the last Old Firm game of last season when he<br>
      walked off the pitch waving a Celtic flag.</div>
      
    <div class="TailParas">  <br>
      In March this year the former Legia Warsaw goalkeeper was shown a yellow card<br>
      by referee Iain Brines for gesturing towards Hibernian fans after Celtic&rsquo;s 2-0<br>
      win at Easter Road.</div>
      
    <div class="TailParas">  <br>
      Mr Campbell&rsquo;s motion states that he supports &ldquo;the good work undertaken in<br>
      combating sectarianism by the Glasgow football clubs, Rangers and Celtic, but<br>
      deeply regrets the actions of Celtic goalkeeper Artur Boruc.&rdquo;</div>
      
    <div class="TailParas">  <br>
      He added: &ldquo;I am saddened that this, the latest in a series of controversial<br>
      gestures by the same player which have no place in football, has not brought<br>
      censure from his club.&rdquo;</div>
      
    <div class="TailParas">  <br>
      His motion has so far been signed by four other MPs.</div>

    <div class="TailParas">  <b>Boruc let-off riles Gers fans<br>
        <br>
      </b>CELTIC&#39;S &quot;Holy Goalie&quot; Artur Boruc will escape punishment despite his &quot;God Bless the Pope&quot; T-shirt antics after Sunday&#39;s Old Firm clash at Parkhead - and Rangers fans are furious.<br>
      <br>
      The SFA do not view the Poland keeper&#39;s actions as provocative or inflammatory as the incident did not occur in front of the Gers support.<br>
      <br>
      Boruc took his jersey off at the end of the second Old Firm clash in 11 days to celebrate a 3-2 victory which sent the Hoops five points clear of their rivals at the top of the SPL.<br>
      <br>
      He then paraded about wearing a white T-shirt showing an image of the late Pope, John Paul II, and the message &quot;God Bless the Pope&quot;.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Last night the Rangers Supporters&#39; Trust expressed bewilderment over the SFA&#39;s inaction, and also blasted Celtic for letting Boruc off the hook.</b></div>
    <b>  
      <div class="TailParas">  <br>
        Spokesman Stephen Smith said: &quot;This was a premeditated act by Boruc and his behaviour was totally inappropriate. The man is a maverick and out of control. Something must be done about his actions.</div>
        
      <div class="TailParas">  <br>
        &quot;Celtic should be making a public statement that they do not condone such behaviour.</div>
        
      <div class="TailParas">  <br>
        &quot;This was a match viewed by fans all over the world and Boruc has let down his profession.&quot;<br>
