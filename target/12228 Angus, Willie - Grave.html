    <font size="2">The replica of the Victoria Cross was designed and  manufactured by Mr  		Angus&#39;s engineer son, the late Nugent Angus. Nugent made the replica  and  		fixed it to the headstone in 1975, covering an original carving of the   		medal into the granite of the stone. The original had weathered and  was  		barely visible.<br>

       		<b>William Angus VC </b>died just two days after the 44th anniversary  of  		his brave deed. His last annual telegram of thanks from the Martin  		family was delivered to him in hospital.</font><br>

    <font size="2">William Angus VC, aged 68, pictured on 5th July 1956. <br>
       		This photograph was taken in Carluke during a civic reception for him,   		Sgt Caldwell VC and Cdr Cameron VC. The occasion was the 100th  		anniversary of the Victoria Cross.<br>
       		Sgt Caldwell returned from Australia, and Cdr Cameron from Hampshire.  		All three attended the 100th celebrations in London, before returning  to  		Carluke where their bravery was again acknowledged by the town.<br>

    <font size="2">His Victoria Cross is displayed in the  		new Scottish War Museum in <b>Edinburgh Castle</b>, where the display  		tells the story of two men who grew up together, who joined the army  		together, went to war together, and thanks to this incredible display  of  		courage and humanity, returned home together. Continuing this theme,  the  		medals of Lt Martin are displayed there alongside William Angus&#39;s VC. 		<br>
       		In these days where the term &#39;hero&#39; is recklessly applied to sportsmen   		and politicians, <b>William Angus VC</b> illustrates the real meaning  of  		the word. We shall seldom see his like again. </font><br>
