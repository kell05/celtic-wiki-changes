    Some players can get just so lucky. Scott Bain had proven himself at Dundee but there was hardly much clamour about him at the time.<br>
    <br>
     Celtic already had 3 stalwarts in the goals line-up ahead of him and so seemed full up but they weren&#39;t all wholly convincing. Firstly, the junior goalkeeper was sent out on loan by Celtic, only to then see Craig Gordon end up with a long term injury v Hibs in a freak on field incident with ex Celt Ambrose. The remaining goalkeeper was De Vries had injury problems, so by luck Bain was to win a loan move to Celtic by default. Incredible! <br>
    <br>
    Ironically at the start of January 2018, Bain was going out on loan from Dundee to Hibs only for the freak circumstances at Celtic to change things; late negotiations led to the Hibs loan being cancelled and Bain put on the next train to Glasgow. He actually left Dundee under a close with his prior manager, ex-Rangers player Neil McCann, which actually warmed him to the Celtic support who had a great antipathy to McCann for both as a player and his often partisan &amp; ignorant match analysis when a Sky Sports pundit. <br>
    <br>
    <div>If that wasn&#39;t drama enough for Bain, then his debut at Celtic was to be quite an entrance too.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div><br>
      He was to be thrown into the fire,making his debut soon after his arrival in place of the injured front two of Gordon &amp; De Vries (both recently quite maligned). Many were concerned especially with an unconvincing defence in front, as Ajer was moved to right back and Boyata was just back from injury. Duly, a mistake by the Celtic defence led to an early goal conceded after just 2.5 minutes, but Bain wasn&#39;t at fault and went onto play a fair role in a fabulous 3-2 victory with a few fine saves that made all positive for his future at Celtic. He was raw but had shown promise, and with the transition period for goalkeepers as he arrived, there was an added incentive to try to make the no.1 shirt his own over time. </div>
    <br>
    <font color="#000000">Following the promise in those games on his loan move, Scott Bain was to sign permanently for 4 years in May 2018: <br>
    </font>
    <blockquote><i><font color="#000000">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it could have gone any better. It&rsquo;s funny, there&rsquo;s a lot of little things that went my way to get to Celtic on loan and then to play the game against Rangers, which sent me on my way to this four-year-deal. It&rsquo;s been great and I&rsquo;ve loved every minute.&rdquo; </font></i><br>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    He finally overtook Craig Gordon as the no.1 in around mid-season of 2018-19, and had an exceptional start with a long string of clean sheets in the first quarter of 2019. Against Airdrie (ne Clydebank) in the Scottish Cup he made five saves in five seconds in one cup game, which astounded everyone. A fine performance with some great saves v Valencia in the UEFA Cup, albiet in a 1-0 defeat in Feb 2019, seemed to cement his place in the side, especially as unlike Craig Gordon, Bain was a lot more comfortable with the ball at his feet. <br>
    <br>
    Celtic were completing the treble-treble and Scott Bain had played his part, growing as a player, and had come a long way. He was the goalkeeper in the Scottish Cup final v Hearts that sealed it all. He had a fine season in 2018/19 with many blank sheets in goals, and won caps for the national side too.<br>

    <h3>Rangers 2-3 Celtic: Scott Bain savours &#39;unbelievable&#39; Celtic debut</h3>
    <br>
    Scott Bain was handed a baptism of fire on Sunday, making his Celtic debut in the Old Firm derby<br>
    <br>
    <a class="external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43365763" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43365763</a><br>
    <br>
    Scott Bain hailed his Celtic debut as the &quot;biggest win&quot; of his career after helping the Scottish champions clinch a pulsating Old Firm derby.The on-loan goalkeeper made his first appearance since 28 October as 10-man Celtic <a class="external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43275522" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#0066cc">beat Rangers 3-2</font></a> at Ibrox.&quot;It was the biggest game I ever played in and the biggest win I have ever had,&quot; Bain, 26, said of the victory.<br>
    <br>
    <div class="bbccom_slot">
      <div class="bbccom_advert">       </div>
    </div>
    &quot;The scenes at the end of the game were unbelievable, like nothing I have ever seen before.&quot;Bain, a January loan signing from Dundee, was beaten by Josh Windass in the third minute gone as Rangers struck first.Tom Rogic equalised, before Daniel Candeias again nudged Rangers ahead, only for Moussa Dembele to level before the break.Celtic defender Jozo Simunovic was sent off for an elbow to the face of Alfredo Morelos, but the depleted visitors landed the crucial blow after 69 minutes, Odsonne Edouard curling home.Bain, at Celtic until the end of the season, made several crucial saves, most notably denying Alfredo Morelos from close range with the Colombian clear through on goal.The striker should have levelled the game in the dying minutes, but could only hit the post from inside the six-yard box, with the goal at his mercy, the ball rebounding into the arms of the Celtic goalkeeper.<br>
    <br>
    Bain and his team-mates took the ecstatic acclaim of their fans at full-time - an experience the stopper says he will cherish.&quot;The fans were superb and I just wanted to savour that after the game and really enjoy it,&quot; Bain said of the celebrations in front of the away stand.&quot;I don&#39;t normally do that but today was special, the way we won the match, going behind twice, going a man down.&quot;I will definitely look back at the end of my career on this and think that was an unbelievable debut to make, especially here at Ibrox.&quot;Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers revealed Bain <font color="#0066cc">was only told he would start</font> on the morning of the match, when fellow goalkeeper Dorus de Vries was ruled out injured.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I thought I handled it well,&quot; Bain said. &quot;I woke to a text at 8am this morning. I knew Dorus might be struggling so I had plenty of time to get myself right and focused on the game.&quot;I was glad that I could contribute to the win.&quot;<br>

    When Scott Bain steps on to the Dens Park pitch this lunchtime for his first competitive game at the ground since his acrimonious parting of the ways with Dundee, the 27-year-old would be entitled to ruminate on the wacky world of football.<br>
    <br>
    Following his last appearance on Tayside on 28 October, 2017 Bain became Public Enemy No.1 for his then manager Neil McCann following a spat between the pair over a 3-1 loss to Hamilton Accies that led to his banishment from the Dundee senior set-up. Just 17 months on, Bain is now No.1 for both a treble-chasing Celtic and his nation, with Scotland manager Alex McLeish presenting him as the anointed one to fill the vacancy created by Allan McGregor&rsquo;s international retirement last week,<br>
    <br>
    It is debatable whether there has been such a swift upturn in fortunes in the career of a Scottish footballer in recent times. Bain, though, refuses to see it as such, which speaks of the equilibrium that has allowed him to remain at ease with his meteoric rise.<br>
    <br>
    He never felt his career had gone to the dogs when McCann barked at him that he was finished at a club to which he gave four good years.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;It was such a short time,&rdquo; Bain says. &ldquo;I always felt that come the January window I would get a move somewhere and go on from there. You don&rsquo;t expect it to go as well as it has and to come to Celtic and be playing at this moment. You can never say you expected this but I expected to get out and play because I knew I had the qualities and ability that a team would want to take.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Bain thought he had got out to play when Neil Lennon took him to Hibernian on loan in January 2018, only for Brendan Rodgers to then sign him for Celtic on the final day of that window without the keeper having played for the Easter Road side. It was a further two months &ndash; and a dramatic 3-2 derby win at Ibrox &ndash; before he would make his Celtic debut following an injury to established No.1 Craig Gordon. Now, he is considered by McLeish as the man to form Scotland&rsquo;s defensive bedrock for the Euro 2020 qualifying campaign that will begin with a double-header comprising away games against Kazakhstan on Thursday and San Marino three days later.<br>
    <br>
    Bain is reluctant to take for granted that, with Sunderland&rsquo;s Jon McLaughlin and Millwall&rsquo;s Jordan Archer also in the squad, he will be given the nod for the two games and so add to the cap he earned against Mexico in Scotland&rsquo;s summer tour of the Americas last June.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll ultimately be down to the manager,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is an opportunity for the three of us and we will all be going in there champing at the bit to be the No.1 and play. Since I have come to Celtic, I have just seen everything as opportunities to play. This is another opportunity that I hope I can take if I am called upon.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Despite the opportunity presented to him, Bain says he was left disappointed by McGregor&rsquo;s decision to step away from international football.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a massive blow for the country because he&rsquo;s a top goalkeeper who&rsquo;s been a great servant for the nation. He&rsquo;ll be a big miss,&rdquo; said Bain, who was first called into a Scotland squad by Gordon Strachan as the result of McGregor withdrawing through injury before the country was scheduled to play a friendly with Qatar and a Euro 2016 encounter away to Republic of Ireland in June 2015.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Every time I was away I was impressed with how good he was &ndash; his speed across the goal and determination not to lose goals. His shot-stopping ability was second to none, really. It was great to work and push yourself to be at that level as well.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Bain has been pushed by huge goalkeeping presences at both country and club level. He played second fiddle to Gordon at Celtic until Rodgers elected to install Bain as first pick only at the start of this year. The Dalkeith-born keeper is at pains to stress this switch has not caused animosity between the pair.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;We always think about each other. We always talk about games and nothing really changes whoever plays. We get on the same way and I still ask him for advice on situations in games. If I think there is something I should have done better or that I should have been in a different position, I will always ask him. He is always honest and it is a good relationship we have.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;It is the same talking about Greegsy [McGregor]. When you work with these players and goalkeepers that are at this standard, you need to raise your game just to be in the same line as them. I think it has put me in a place where I need to be at my very best every day and I am really enjoying working with Craigy and Woodsy [Celtic and Scotland goalkeeping coach Stevie Woods] and trying to be at that standard all the time.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Bain&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the game means he treats every game he plays with the same relish, which appears to translate into impressively nerveless displays. There is no sense that sentiment will come into play on his return to Dens Park for today&rsquo;s game &ndash; which will be immediately followed by Bain and fellow club internationalists James Forrest, Callum McGregor, Kieran Tierney and Oliver Burke flying out with the Scotland squad to Kazakhstan.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still a few boys that were there when I was there,&rdquo; Bain said. &ldquo;Most of the boys I played with have moved on to different clubs. I&rsquo;m really just treating it as any other game and will try and go up there and do what I&rsquo;ve been doing for the club in recent games.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;I have enjoyed every game that I have played for this club and I think that has been the key for me, really. I am at a stage now where I am just trying to improve and I am not focused on anyone else.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;It is just a case of seeing how good I can be. How much can I improve and where can I improve? It has been really positive for me to be in that mindset. In terms of big games, I have always gone in thinking that this could be my last big game to play in and that I have to enjoy the occasion. I made my [Celtic] debut at Ibrox and really enjoyed the [Betfred] cup final against Aberdeen [in December]. Since coming in, every game has been a massive game for us and will continue to be until the end of the season.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Another quirk of the season has been Bain finding himself being overseen by Lennon at Celtic following the departure of Rodgers to Leicester City. It was Lennon, then Hibs manager, who gave him the escape route from Dundee with a loan move to Easter Road that ended up seeing the pair actively work together there for little more than a week.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;When he [Lennon] got the [Celtic] job we had a meeting and he just said, &lsquo;we got there eventually&rsquo;,&rdquo; Bain explains.<br>
    <br>
    It could be a tagline for his circuitous route to the summit of his sport.
