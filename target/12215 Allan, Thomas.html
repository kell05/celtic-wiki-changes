    The Carluke-born centre-forward made just two competitive appearances for the Bhoys in three seasons at Celtic Park.   <br>
    <br>
    <div>He joined Celtic in January <a href="/page/1910" target="_self">1910</a> from Carluke Milton Rovers, although one newspaper report indicates that he may have actually signed for Law Volunteers (another local Lanarkshire side).<br>
      <br>
      He was reputedly &quot;<i>a centre forward of whom big things are promised</i>&quot;.<br>
      <br>
      At Celtic, he went on to play in a string of friendlies before making his full competitive debut in a scoreless home draw with <a href="/page/Hibernian" target="_self">Hibs</a> in the league. That game - on 25th April 1910 - saw the Celts clinch the title, a then record 6 championships in a row - and Allan was selected as a replacement for the injured <a href="/page/Quinn%2C+Jimmy+%281900-15%29" target="_self">Jimmy Quinn</a>. </div>
    <br>
    <div>He played the final league game of that season - another 0-0, at Dundee - but being well behind the Mighty Quinn for a starting spot, Allan was never to wear the Hoops again in a competitive match.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div><br>
      His two matches were the final matches of the 1910/11 season, and can be seen as trial matches for him, but it wasn&#39;t to be. Two no score draw games is a disappointment for any centre-forward, but he got to play in a league title winning side and the ultimate winning game (albeit practically all the work had already been done by the time he was in the side). <br>
      <br>
      Celtic won the league title by just 2pts over Falkirk. If Celtic had lost both of these games, then depending on the outcome of Falkirk&#39;s remaining matches, things could have been very much different, the goal difference was similar and Falkirk actually had a better scoring record.</div>
    <br>
    <div>Loan spells at Airdrie and Vale of Leven followed before being released in the summer of <a href="/page/1913" target="_self">1913</a>.<br>
      <br>
      He is believed to have died in 1974, aged 83, a long life.</div>
