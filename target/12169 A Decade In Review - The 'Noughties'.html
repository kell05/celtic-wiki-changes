    The noughties were the first full decade when the Celtic support were able to follow the team on the internet. So whether you&#39;re in New York, Hong Kong or Coatbridge it has never been so easy to follow the Hoops. As the web grew sites like Kerrydalestreet.co.uk and other messageboards flourished, with thousands of supporters from every part of the globe coming together all day, every day to discuss anything and everything Celtic.<br>
    <br>
    With this in mind it was decided to let this worldwide collection of Hoops fans have their say on the key games, goals and personalities which shaped a truly memorable decade for Celtic. <br>
    <br>
    The &#39;Poll of the Decade&#39; ran from December 2009 to February 2010 and offered Celtic fans the chance to nominate, vote and discuss the crucial events and individuals of what was, even by Celtic standards, an incredibly eventful 10 years.<br>
    <br>
    In an attempt to capture as much flavour of the decade as possible a total of 10 categories were selected and once the nominations were in thousands of fans got their chance to vote for their top choice in each section.<br>
    <br>
    All the categories are listed below and to discover the winner of each section simply click on the appropriate link!<font size="2"><br>
