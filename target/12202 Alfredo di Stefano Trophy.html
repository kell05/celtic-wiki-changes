     They assumed they would also have the trophy in the Bernabeu Stadium  in 1967, but Celtic had other ideas. It appears that Real were rather  &lsquo;put out&rsquo; by Celtic winning &lsquo;their&rsquo; trophy, with the Spanish press  claiming that the European Cup belonged in Madrid. So it is  understandable that, when choosing an appropriate team to honour the  great Di Stefano, Celtic were approached and, indeed, were thrilled to  accept the challenge.<br>
    <br>
    The sides had met back in 1963, with  Celtic losing 3-1 in a charity game in Glasgow. On June 7, 1967, just  two weeks after they won the European Cup in Lisbon, Celtic took on Real  Madrid at the Bernabeu. There was one change from the Lisbon team, with  John Fallon replacing Ronnie Simpson in goal.<br>
    <br>
    Di Stefano  played for 20 minutes of the game and received a standing ovation from  the 130,000 supporters inside the stadium when he left the pitch.  Neither side played as one might expect in a friendly match, but instead  competed fiercely to win the match. And taking centre stage on  the night was Jimmy Johnstone, whose skill and artistry completely  mesmerised the Madrid players.<br>
    <br>
    Indeed, such was the  brilliance of Jinky that the Spanish support cheered him, shouting  &lsquo;Ole!&rsquo; whenever he was on the ball. Despite many discussions during my  tours here at Celtic Park, when a good few men advised me that it was  Jinky who scored the only goal of the game, such was the magnificence of  his performance that night, it was, in fact, Bobby Lennox who netted  the winner.<br>
    <br>
    It is also fitting to say that Alfredo Di  Stefano had been in Lisbon for the European Cup and had apparently gone  to Celtic&rsquo;s hotel to wish Jock Stein all the best for the game against  Inter Milan. It could be that it was during this game that the great man  decided the famous green and white hoops would be the perfect opponents  to celebrate his own wonderful football career.<br>
    <br>
    It was a  fantastic night in Madrid. Just when we thought it couldn&rsquo;t get any  better, here was the icing on a big, fat, beautiful cake. <br>
