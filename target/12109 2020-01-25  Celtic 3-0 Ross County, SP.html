      <li><b>Celtic finally regain a clear top spot </b>as Sevco lose their advantage in the league. However Celtic will be net only two pts ahead.</li>
      <li>Sevco lost 2-1 to Hearts on next day (Sunday); Hearts were bottom of the  league. Sevco&#39;s only second league defeat of the season to date! Celtic  now clear top of the league even if Sevco win their game in hand.  Celtic 5pts ahead now (but Sevco still have one game in hand).</li>
      <li><b>  Griffiths</b> started the match ahead of Edouard. Possibly to give him a lift up especially after the abuse he has had from the media etc past week. Eddie later came on for Griffiths and scored with his first twice and twice within a few minutes!</li>

    (Verde Blanco of KDS)<br>
    Very lacklustre performance in the 1st half especially. If the Ross  County forwards were more clinical then we could have been a goal or two  down prior to the penalty. We created one chance of note in the first  half when their keeper pulled off an excellent save from Forrest. But  that was that from us in the first half.<br>
     <br>
     Edouard gave us a lift and made an instant impact &amp; was easily MOTM  despite only playing for about 30 mins. I think that tells us all we  need to know about how his teammates performed in the first 60 minutes.<br>
     <br>
     In the end though it could&#39;ve been 4 or 5-0 but that first 45 minutes was very concerning.<br>

    <h3>  Celtic 3 - 0 Ross County: Two-goal Odsonne Edouard provides a stunning cameo</h3>

    Updated: 23:23 Saturday 25 January 2020<br>
    <br>
    There was a pertinent reminder at Celtic Park that, however the Leigh Griffiths renaissance progresses this season, the supreme striker at Parkhead is always going to be Odsonne Edouard.<br>
    <br>
    The Scottish champions looked rough around the edges and rode their luck for the hour that the Frenchman was held in reserve on the bench because of a toe issue.<br>
    <br>
    Then the 22-year-old was unleashed &ndash; replacing Griffiths &ndash; and within minutes had stamped his authority all over an encounter that Ross County made far more uncomfortable for their hosts than had been anticipated. To no avail, though, as Celtic extended their Premiership lead over Rangers to five points, ahead of the Ibrox club&rsquo;s trip to Tynecastle today for one of the two games they have in hand over their rivals.<br>
    <br>
    It was curious to see such a quiet afternoon for Griffiths on the back of his agenda-seizing week, whether through scoring two goals in two starts, or tape-gate, or appearing to inspire a war on football punditry.<br>
    <br>
    Nothing seemed to fall for the 29-year-old as he sought to reassert himself. Edouard, in contrast, instantly appeared a magnet for making things happen, as he put the contest beyond doubt with a couple of crucial, class interventions.<br>
    <br>
    His first touch of the afternoon proved a stooping, almost nonchalant header into the net from a Callum McGregor corner in the 65th minute that had arced over the head of Christopher Jullien almost as if making a beeline to the striker.<br>
    <br>
    Four minutes later, Edouard started a move that led to James Forrest sliding the ball into him from the right. A typically elegant jink away from his marker made him all the space he needed to slot a precision drive into the far corner.<br>
    <br>
    The goals brought the player&rsquo;s club tally for the season to 20 and his dazzling cameo secured a convincing-looking win from an afternoon in which the Scottish champions had been anything but convincing in the opening stages.<br>
    <br>
    County were left to curse not capitalising on what, Neil Lennon conceded, were an &ldquo;ill at ease&rdquo; centre-back pairing of Jozo Simunovic and Jullien, the Celtic manager switching from a midweek three to a flat defensive four as the result of Kristoffer Ajer missing out with a virus.<br>
    <br>
    In the 25th minute, Jonny Hayes was also posted missing at left-back to allow Josh Mullin to get in behind him and deliver a cut-back that found Blair Spittal with oodles of time and space to finish. Instead, he contrived to tug his effort beyond the post from all of ten yards. It was a howling miss.<br>
    <br>
    Celtic, who squandered a couple of early openings themselves, were able to breathe another huge sigh of relief shortly afterwards. Don Cowie &ndash; making his first senior start for nine months &ndash; paced down the right and, from a tight angle, produced a low drive that proved only inches wide of the far post.<br>
    <br>
    Growing anxiety among the denizens in the home stands was allayed when Keith Watson appeared to catch Mikey Johnston as he turned in the box nine minutes before the interval in a challenge that had referee Kevin Clancy pointing to the spot without hesitation. McGregor stepped up to drive the spot-kick out of reach of Nathan Baxter&rsquo;s right hand and, save for Fraser Forster superbly thwarting Spittal with his outstretched foot between Edouard&rsquo;s goals, County never thereafter threatened an upset.<br>
    <br>
    Having had ten goals thumped past them in their previous two meetings with Celtic, the Dingwall side &ndash; at Ibrox on Wednesday &ndash; could feel they had made progress only to be undone by misfortune&hellip; and an outrageously special talent.<br>
    <br>
     <br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a bad substitute to have,&rdquo; said joint manager Steven Ferguson of Edouard. &ldquo;Celtic can do that &ndash; they can change personnel and change shape to allow them to go about things slightly differently. Sometimes they are able to replace really good players with even better players. He scored his two goals but we feel we could have defended them better.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;We wanted to make sure we were in the game but also offer a threat at the other end. The chances we created suggests we got that right.&rdquo;  <br>

      <br>
      By Jonathan Sutherland<br>
      <br>
      BBC Scotland at Celtic Park<br>
      <br>
       From the section Scottish Premiership <br>

      Odsonne Edouard stooped to head home with his first touch and double Celtic&#39;s lead<br>
      Odsonne Edouard stooped to head home with his first touch and double Celtic&#39;s lead<br>
      <br>
      Odsonne Edouard came off the bench to crush Ross County with a four-minute double and push lacklustre Celtic five points clear at the Scottish Premiership summit.<br>
      <br>
      The visitors exploited the hosts&#39; shaky defence in the first half and Josh Mullin, Blair Spittal and Don Cowie all missed the target with good chances.<br>
      <br>
      But Callum McGregor&#39;s penalty - after a Keith Watson trip on Mikey Johnston - nudged Celtic ahead before the break and Edouard&#39;s 63rd-minute introduction put the outcome beyond doubt.<br>
      <br>
      The French striker headed home McGregor&#39;s corner with his first touch and added a quick second for his 20th goal of the season to extend the gap at the top.<br>
      <br>
      Closest challengers Rangers, who have two games in hand, attempt to narrow the lead when they face Hearts on Sunday.<br>
      <br>
      Eighth-place County are now five games without a league win and remain four points above the relegation play-off spot.<br>
      <br>
       Reaction &amp; as it happened<br>
      <br>
      Fatal mistake leads to County downfall<br>
      <br>
      To say County came into this game as massive underdogs was a huge understatement - apparently they were the longest odds of any side in Europe to get a win this afternoon.<br>
      <br>
      The bookies are rarely wrong, but arguably the Dingwall side looked the more likely to take the lead.<br>
      <br>
      First a fantastic pass from Spittal sliced Celtic right open as Mullin raced in on goal, but he got too much on his lob and the ball looped over the bar.<br>
      <br>
      Mullin would then return the favour, cutting back for Spittal midway inside the Celtic box but with the goal gaping he screwed his shot wide.<br>
      <br>
      Veteran midfielder Cowie also angled a shot past the post as County continued to pose a threat while the murmurs of discontent grew in volume among the home faithful.<br>
      <br>
      Celtic were a bit flat but their sheer quality ensured chances would occur in the first half, with headers from Christopher Jullien and James Forrest forcing saves from Nathan Baxter.<br>
      <br>
      Forrest also flashed an inviting low ball across goal which Griffiths looked sure to tap in at the back post, but there was just a touch too much pace on it.<br>
      Edouard stat<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes one mistake is all it takes and that was the case for County. The ball arrived at the tricky feet of Johnston in the penalty box, he turned smartly and was tripped by Watson.<br>
      <br>
      Up stepped McGregor who fired expertly into the bottom right-hand corner for his eighth goal of the season.<br>
      <br>
      Edouard had been left on the bench with a slight toe injury, but he entered the fray for Griffiths and made an immediate impact.<br>
      <br>
      From a McGregor corner the French striker nodded home from close range at the back post as Celtic doubled their lead.<br>
      <br>
      Straight after that Spittal had a chance well saved by Forster before Edouard was at it again.<br>
      <br>
      This time a more conventional Edouard finish underlined his massive importance to Celtic, the French Under-21 international weaving into the box before firing home to make it 3-0 and end the game as a contest.<br>
      Man of the match - Odsonne Edouard<br>
      <br>
      One of the great debates of this Scottish football season is who is best - Edouard of Celtic or Alfredo Morelos of Rangers?<br>
      <br>
      That debate will rage on for a few months yet, but Edouard once again proved just how valuable he is to Neil Lennon&#39;s side.<br>
      <br>
      It was a quiet afternoon for Griffiths, who came off for Edouard, and the Frenchman made short work of sealing another vital three points for the champions.<br>
      <br>
      He has already surpassed his league goal tally of last season and his importance to Celtic as they strive to make it nine titles in a row cannot be overstated.<br>
      &#39;Outstanding &amp; talismanic&#39; - reaction<br>
      Edouard gave Celtic a spark - Lennon<br>
      <br>
      Celtic manager Neil Lennon: &quot;Once we got the first goal I thought we controlled the game. That&#39;s two very good wins in the league. We are starting to build again.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Odsonne is hugely important, he is an outstanding footballer, almost talismanic. He is up there with some of the best we&#39;ve had over the last 20 years.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ross County co-manager Steven Ferguson: &quot;We created really good chances and, at places like this, you need to take them. We should have managed the goals we lost better. We felt it was a soft penalty but we have played our part in losing the other two.&quot;<br>
      <br>

      <h3>Celtic 3-0 Ross County: Neil Lennon praises &#39;talismanic&#39; two-goal Odsonne Edouard</h3>
      <br>
       From the section Celtic <br>
      <br>
      Edouard gave Celtic a spark - Lennon<br>
      <br>
      Celtic manager Neil Lennon hailed &quot;talismanic&quot; Odsonne Edouard after the striker played despite a toe injury to inspire the Scottish Premiership leaders to victory over Ross County.<br>
      <br>
      Edouard was only fit enough for the bench but netted twice within five minutes of coming on to seal a 3-0 win.<br>
      <br>
      Celtic had toiled until the devastating impact of the 22-year-old, who took his tally to 20 goals this season.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;You always worry about a toe injury, it was quite tender,&quot; Lennon said.<br>
      <br>
       Edouard double sends Celtic five points clear<br>
       Lennon wants compassion for Griffiths<br>
       Depth gives Celtic title edge - Strachan<br>
      <br>
      &quot;His foot was in a boot. But he did a fitness session last night and said it felt a lot better. He looked fine and fresh and you could see the lift he gave to the team and his second goal was a great finish.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We were concerned he wouldn&#39;t do the 90 minutes so it has worked out okay. He had an incredible impact when he came on and should be okay for Wednesday [away to St Johnstone].<br>
      <br>
      &quot;He is hugely important. He is an outstanding footballer, almost talismanic. He is up there with some of the best we&#39;ve had over the last 20 years.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Edouard&#39;s double hoisted him to 15 league goals this season - one more than his total for last term, where he scored 23 in all competitions.<br>
      <br>
      His intervention was vital in a game which Celtic, fielding a makeshift defence due to injuries, led through Callum McGregor&#39;s first-half penalty but allowed County a string of clear opportunities.<br>
      <br>
      Celtic are now five points clear of Rangers, who have played two games fewer and face Hearts at Tynecastle on Sunday.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;It [20 goals] is fantastic,&quot; Lennon added. &quot;Odsonne is playing better than ever and we are delighted with that.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I am delighted with the goal tallies of a lot of the players, Odsonne, Ryan Christie, James Forrest, they are well into double figures. I think that is McGregor&#39;s eighth and we are racking up the goals.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;First half we weren&#39;t at the races. But once we got the all-important first goal we controlled the game. It&#39;s a fantastic win and a very important one.&quot;  </div>
