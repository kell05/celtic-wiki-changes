      <li><b>                  Sunday game</b></li>
      <li><b>World Palindrome Day</b>: 02 02 2020 This is the first time in over 900 years (since 11/11/1111) the date is palindromic no matter the date format. It&rsquo;s also the 33rd day of the year with 333 days left! Appropriately Celtic debutant Stephen Welsh is 20 and was born in 2000, and Celtic&#39;s number 2 scored the 2nd goal for Celtic who increased their lead over Sevco in the league title race by 2 more points! And Edouard who is no.22 scored 2 goals!.</li>
      <li><b>Scott Brown</b> has played his 700th competitive top level match; note around 150 of those games are with Hibs.</li>
      <li>Celtic <b>increase lead at top of the league to 7pts</b> (albeit Sevco still have game in hand). Sevco drew 0-0 with Aberdeen the day before. Welcome surprise.<br>
      </li>
      <li>This was a poor game for Celtic. Went behind, dreadful first half and struggled to get a hold of the game. A first half equaliser helped things followed by a late show which finally collapsed ten man Hamilton. The pitch is plastic but can&#39;t keep using that as an excuse.</li>
      <li>TheScotsman reporting that Celtic has greatest &lsquo;player loyalty&rsquo; in SP:  42.1 average months played. In fairness not an equal comparison for  smaller clubs.  </li>
      <li>Debut for <b><a href="/page/Welsh%2C+Stephen" target="_self">Stephen Welsh</a> </b>(completely out of the blue), was just recalled from Morton last week. Bauer on the bench, El Hamed out injured etc. An assured debut from Welsh.   Dealt with the direct and physical approach of Hamilton more comfortably than his experienced defensive partners.</li>
      <li>The Hoops fans, who packed into the stand behind one goal at the  Fountain of Youth Stadium, displayed the message which simply read in jest:  &quot;<b>Rangers = Coronavirus</b>&quot;. The virus, which causes respiratory infection and  has been identified as the cause of the Wuhan outbreak in December, has  so far killed more than 200 people and more than 8,200 confirmed cases  have been identified.The banner was just football rivalry humour, nothing malicious.</li>
      <li>Bizarre weekend: The mystery around the apparent  tampering of <b>Sevco&#39;s Alfredo Morelos&#39; car </b>has reportedly been  solved, after it was revealed a private investigator told police he was  the man involved.                  According to the Sunday Mail, the man arrested in  connection with the incident, in which the Rangers striker apparently  discovered a person crouching down near his Lamborghini and immediately  gave chase, stated that he had been hired by the footballer&#39;s wife. Social Media &amp; Sevco had been full of allegations and threats v Celtic fans claimign that Celtic fans were actually threatening his life &amp; family and tampering with his car to cut his breaks! The truth is that he has been supposedly been playing away from home (any details/allegations are for away from this site) and his pregnant wife put up a Private Investigator (an ex-Army veteran) to investigate. LOL</li>
      <li><b>Morelos situation:</b> Allegations of racism made against Celtic fans - no evidence. Allegations of death threats to referees made against Celtic fans - no evidence. Allegations of brake tampering made against Celtic fans - no evidence. Allegations of Sevco being title contenders - no evidence.</li>
      <li>Rugby: 6N has started with Scottish rugby  in the doldrums after a pathetic 2019 (yet still gave their directors  whopping bonuses/pay rises etc). Scotland lost away to Ireland (as expected), England lost away to France (unexpected). Wales beat Italy</li>
      <li>AmFootball: SuperBowl final this weekend. San Francisco 49ers v Kansas City Chiefs, the KC Chiefs won for first time in 50 years. so congrats!</li>
      <li>Politics: The UK sadly left the EU on Friday, against the wishes of Scotland.  </li>
      <li><b>Transfers:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Window has shut</li>
        <li>Celtic have allegedly knocked back a  bid from Gillingham to take highly-rated youngster Karamoko Dembele on  loan for the remainder of the season.</li>
        <li><b>Lewis Morgan</b> has signed for Inter Miami, good luck to him.</li>
        <li>No big end-day stuff for Celtic, no Wanyama (too expensive) or Benkovic (went to Bristol City).</li>

    <b>Lennon </b>&ldquo;Tough game. We didn&rsquo;t play well first half. A question of patience. We knew once we got 2nd goal it would change. Our subs were excellent. Griffiths isn&rsquo;t a red card. Odsonne free kick amazing. James was excellent. It&rsquo;s nice to be 7 pts clear&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    <b>Christie</b>: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know (Christopher Jullien had that kind of finish in him)!  When I crossed it in and looked up and saw it was him in there, I was a  bit â€¨surprised. Fair play to him, he&rsquo;s starting to get his goal tally up  as well which is very nice to have from a central defender in your  team.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    (JBC of TheCelticWiki)<br>
    Most misleading scoreline of the season so far, but I&#39;m not really complaining as we have stretched our league title lead... <br>
    <br>
    <div>This was a poor game for Celtic. Went behind, dreadful first half and  struggled to get a hold of the game. A first half equaliser helped  things followed by a late show which finally collapsed ten man Hamilton.  The pitch is plastic but can&#39;t keep using that as an excuse. As for the supposed stamp by Griffiths, it wasn&#39;t it was handbags and players getting entangled.<br>
      <br>
      Deep into the second half, it felt this game was a lost cause and we&#39;d squandered a chance to take advantage of Sevco&#39;s trip up yesterday.</div>
    <div>The result the only thing that mattered. Laboured for a long period but strength (and creativity) on the bench plus the genius of Edouard made it comfortable by the end.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div><br>
      A lot needs to improve here, the team was not on form but that&#39;s been the case for too many games for too long now. </div>

    On an overcast afternoon when they were far from their best for long spells, Celtic opened up daylight at the top of the Premiership with an ultimately comprehensive victory over Hamilton Accies.<br>
    <br>
    The final scoreline was harsh on Accies who took the lead through Marios Ogkmpoe and then performed with admirable resolve after being reduced to 10 men with the first half dismissal of defender Jamie Hamilton.<br>
    <br>
    But Celtic found the ruthless streak necessary to get the job done, inspired by top scorer Odsonne Edouard who claimed a double to take his tally for the season to 22.<br>
    <br>
    Neil Lennon&rsquo;s men duly took full advantage of Rangers&rsquo; latest slip at home to Aberdeen on Saturday with the eight in a row title winners now seven points clear of their Old Firm rivals.<br>
    <br>
    The uncertain start Celtic made to the contest owed much to the contribution of Accies&rsquo; goalscorer Ogkmpoe whose physicality and movement was a source of real anxiety to the visitors&rsquo; defence in which 20-year-old Stephen Welsh made his first team debut.<br>
    <br>
    It was the more experienced figure of Jullien who was most troubled by Ogkmpoe as the division&rsquo;s basement side tried to take the game to the champions whenever possible.<br>
    <br>
    Celtic struggled to find their customary fluency in the early stages, although it took a brilliantly timed penalty box challenge from Accies captain Aaron McGowan to deny Edouard what would have been a simple chance in the seventh minute.<br>
    <br>
    Callum McGregor also saw a shot blocked by the home defence, after Leigh Griffiths was unable to get a Greg Taylor cross under control, but much of Celtic&rsquo;s work lacked conviction.<br>
    <br>
    The home fans were incensed in the 13th minute when Griffiths collected the first caution of the afternoon for an off the ball clash with Sam Woods. The striker appeared to leave a foot in on the grounded Accies player, prompting the angry reaction from the hosts who felt it was a red card offence. Alex Gogic was also booked for his show of dissent to referee Nick Walsh.<br>
    <br>
    A mistake from Kristoffer Ajer presented the lively Ogkmpoe with his first sight of goal in the 21st minute. His powerful first time volley was matched by a fine reaction save from Fraser Forster at the Celtic goalkeeper&rsquo;s left hand post.<br>
    <br>
    But Forster was left exposed and beaten when Ogkmpoe put Accies in front five minutes later. Scott McMann forced the ball off Welsh for a corner on the left which Blair Alston swung towards the near post. Ogkmpoe escaped Jullien&rsquo;s tame attempt to block his run and sent a firm header beyond Forster from close range.<br>
    <br>
    Accies&rsquo; breakthrough certainly couldn&rsquo;t be said to have come against the run of play but their hopes of building on it were scuppered by the dismissal of young defender Hamilton 10 minutes before the interval.<br>
    <br>
    The teenager was caught on the wrong side of Griffiths as they challenged for a long through ball from Jullien. Hamilton tugged the striker back on the edge of the penalty area, a rash action as the ball appeared to be running through to goalkeeper Luke Southwood.<br>
    Celtic fans display the banner<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    It proved to be a case of double jeopardy for the home side as Hamilton was shown a straight red card and Edouard stepped up to brilliantly guide the free-kick over the wall and beyond Southwood&rsquo;s left hand for his 21st goal of the season.<br>
    <br>
    Edouard missed a decent chance to put Celtic ahead a minute before the break when he lofted a shot over from just inside the penalty area as the visitors looked to press home their personnel advantage.<br>
    <br>
    Accies defended resolutely with Shaun Want, introduced at the expense of David Moyo as the 10 men reshuffled tactically, typifying their determination with a superb block to prevent another chance for Edouard as Celtic upped the tempo in the second half.<br>
    <br>
    The hosts were also riding their luck at times, surviving a couple of penalty claims for handball against Scott Martin and McGowan, while Southwood made a magnificent save when he touched a Griffiths free-kick onto his crossbar.<br>
    <br>
    Accies did occasionally threaten on the counter attack, Ogkmpoe unsettling the league leaders again when he beat Jullien on the right and whipped a dangerous ball across the face of the six yard box which was just too strong for McMann to connect with.<br>
    <br>
    Lennon brought on Ryan Christie and Tom Rogic in a bid to inject fresh creativity to his side in the closing stages and it paid off as Hamilton&rsquo;s dogged resistance was finally overcome.<br>
    <br>
    Celtic went in front with 12 minutes remaining when Christie&rsquo;s cross from the left was met by Jullien, the big defender&rsquo;s foray forward rewarded with a sublime side-foot finish which any striker would have been proud of.<br>
    <br>
    Accies&rsquo; race was run and their heads visibly dropped. Celtic took the opportunity to add gloss to the scoreline and boost their already impressive goal difference.<br>
    <br>
    Edouard made it 3-1 when he collected a return pass from Rogic and coolly slid a low shot beyond Southwood, a goal which prompted an exuberant celebration from Lennon who ran onto the pitch.<br>
    <br>
    Having passed up a simple chance to complete his hat-trick when he shot wide from close range, Edouard turned provider in stoppage time with a cutback to Forrest who swept Celtic&rsquo;s fourth high into the net.  <br>
    <br>

    Neil Lennon believes Celtic now have a significant psychological advantage in the title race after their 4-1 win at Hamilton Accies on Sunday.<br>
    <br>
    The Scottish champions made the most of rivals Rangers having dropped two more points at home to Aberdeen the previous day, coming from behind to overcome bottom of the table Accies with a late flurry of goals.<br>
    <br>
    Celtic are now seven points clear of Rangers at the top of the Premiership, having played one game more than the Ibrox side.<br>
    <br>
    Lennon sprinted onto the pitch to celebrate the second of Odsonne Edouard&rsquo;s two goals in his team&rsquo;s victory and the Celtic manager admitted his reaction was an indication of how important he feels the result is in the context of the quest for a ninth consecutive league triumph.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;It&rsquo;s called relief,&rdquo; said Lennon. &ldquo;You want to capitalise and make the most of things. When the third went in, we had three points wrapped up.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Psychologically, it&#39;s good. I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s four points rather than seven as I&rsquo;m assuming the opposition will win their game in hand. But it&rsquo;s the first buffer we&rsquo;ve had for a while.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the first half and losing a goal from a set play is disappointing. But the reaction of the players was very good. I&rsquo;m proud of them and the momentum we have built at the start of the year is fantastic.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Accies assistant-manager Guillaume Beuzelin, in charge as manager Brian Rice began his five-match suspension for gambling offences, had no complaints about the 34th minute dismissal of defender Jamie Hamilton for a foul on Leigh Griffiths.<br>
    <br>
    But Beuzelin felt Griffiths should have been sent off earlier for an off the ball clash with Sam Woods which referee Nick Walsh deemed only worthy of a yellow card.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Watching live, that&rsquo;s what I thought,&rdquo; said Beuzelin. &ldquo;We all thought that on the bench and we were 30 metres away. Maybe the angle the ref had meant he couldn&rsquo;t see that.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;The fourth official or assistant maybe could have helped him. If it happened, it would have been a massive turnaround but I don&rsquo;t want to comment on that. We already have one banned, I don&rsquo;t want to be the next.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Our red card is a bit soft but Jamie needs to learn. He&rsquo;s 17, facing a great player with the experience of Leigh Griffiths who&rsquo;s turned him. He needs to not get so tight and then we were punished when they made it 1-1 from the free-kick.&rdquo;  <br>

      Odsonne Edouard scores Celtic&#39;s third goal at the Fountain of Youth Stadium<br>
      <br>
      Celtic moved seven points clear in the Scottish Premiership after scoring three times in the final 12 minutes to beat 10-man Hamilton Academical.<br>
      <br>
      Marios Ogkmpoe gave the hosts a shock lead as Celtic attempted to capitalise on Rangers&#39; draw with Aberdeen.<br>
      <br>
      However, Jamie Hamilton&#39;s red card changed the game, with Odsonne Edouard levelling from the resulting free-kick.<br>
      <br>
      Accies defended bravely but late goals from Christopher Jullien, Edouard and James Forrest left them bottom.<br>
      <br>
      Head coach Brian Rice, serving the first game of his touchline ban for gambling breaches, watched from the stand as defeat leaves his side behind 11th-place Hearts on goal difference.<br>
      <br>
      Celtic, though, have now won 10 consecutive domestic matches away from Celtic Park and have cleaved open a significant lead at the summit, albeit having played a game more.<br>
      <br>
       Gap &#39;psychologically good&#39; for Celtic<br>
       How did you rate the players?<br>
      <br>
      Scoreline harsh on Hamilton<br>
      <br>
      Celtic were far from their slick best but, once they got back on level terms in the pivotal moment of the match, they were always likely to ease clear of a hitherto impressive Accies side.<br>
      <br>
      No-one impressed more in the opening half-hour than the goalscorer Ogkmpoe, who had already caused Jullien and Kristoffer Ajer significant problems and forced Fraser Forster into a good save before finding the net.<br>
      <br>
      Scott McMann skinned Forrest down the left to win a corner, which Blair Alston flighted in, and Ogkmpoe beat Jullien to it to head past Forster at the near post.<br>
      <br>
      It was only Ogkmpoe&#39;s second league goal of the season, both of them against Celtic.<br>
      <br>
      The lead did not flatter Accies but things turned against them in the space of 90 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      Leigh Griffiths, who had earlier escaped with a yellow card when treading on Sam Woods&#39; chest, got goal-side of 17-year-old Hamilton and then tumbled as the defender desperately tried to recover the situation, wrapping his arms around the striker.<br>
      <br>
      Referee Nick Walsh produced the red card for Hamilton and, to compound Accies&#39; misery, Edouard swept the free-kick over the wall and past Luke Southwood from the edge of the box.<br>
      Celtic&#39;s James Forrest and Jonny Hayes<br>
      <br>
      From that point onwards, the one-way traffic towards the Accies goal was relentless. The home side&#39;s defending, though, was immense.<br>
      <br>
      Shaun Want blocked brilliantly from Edouard to deny the Frenchman from point-blank range.<br>
      <br>
      Griffiths forced a fingertip save from Southwood, the keeper touching the free-kick on to the bar, and Accies survived two penalty claims - Walsh correctly deciding Aaron McGowan&#39;s handballs were not deliberate.<br>
      <br>
      The introduction of Ryan Christie proved key. It was his inch-perfect delivery from the left that found Jullien, who still had plenty to do but his deft volley was sublime and flashed past Southwood.<br>
      <br>
      And shortly afterwards Edouard buried Accies by powering forward, exchanging passes with Tom Rogic, and sliding the ball into the net.<br>
      <br>
      Forrest&#39;s injury-time strike - set up by Edouard - put a gloss on the scoreline that was harsh on Accies and flattering to Celtic.<br>
      <br>
      But this was another massive win for the champions. Great credit to Accies but they stay bottom as Celtic move further clear.<br>
      Man of the match - Odsonne Edouard<br>
      <br>
      Ogkmpoe&#39;s first-half display deserves a further mention, as does Alex Gogic&#39;s defensive performance almost throughout.<br>
      <br>
      But ultimately Edouard&#39;s thoroughbred status was reaffirmed with his goals and assist for Forrest. Even a glaring miss for a hat-trick could not take the shine off.<br>
      &#39;We need to go into survival mode&#39; - reaction<br>
      Griffiths &#39;clearly stood on Hamilton player&#39; - Beuzelin<br>
      <br>
      Hamilton assistant Guillaume Beuzelin: &quot;Again we have zero points, but for 75 minutes we competed well. It&#39;s harsh but there are positives for us too.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The red card is a bit harsh but I can see why it&#39;s given. Before, there was an incident when we clearly saw a stamp on one of our players. Maybe the referee could not see properly.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Now were are bottom of the league, we need to go into survival mode. We&#39;ve done it for five years. We know what to do.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Celtic manager Neil Lennon: &quot;We had to be patient. We had to be concentrated. Hamilton defended for their lives and you need to give them credit for that.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The three points are massive for us, under the circumstances. It opens up a nice gap.&quot;  </div>
