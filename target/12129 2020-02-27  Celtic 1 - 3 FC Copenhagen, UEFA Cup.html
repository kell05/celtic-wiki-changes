    <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz"><b>Neil Lennon:</b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hugely disappointed because we basically shot ourselves in the foot,control in the first half, I don&rsquo;t remember Fraser Forster  having much to do. We had all the flow, we hit the post and had crosses  going across the goal. At half time we were really pleased with the way  the game had gone.&quot;</div>
    <br>
    <font color="#333333" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">flinchy of KDS</font>
    <div>1. Simunovic is done<br>
       2. Ajer is a liability<br>
       3. Broony needs managed a lot better<br>
       4. Rogic needs more game time<br>
       5. Eddy needs to remove his head from his rear end<br>
       6. Forrest needs benched. Don&#39;t care who for.<br>
       7. Moi still isn&#39;t fit.<br>
       8. Lennon didn&#39;t change it quickly enough. Again.<br>
       9. We are still wasteful in front of goal.<br>
       <br>
       A game of bad habits from us. Forrest not flinging himself at that one in the first half summed it up.<br>
      <br>
      (MLE of KDS)<br>
      First half was pretty decent; it was good to see Rogic and Elyounoussi  coming back into the kind of play they&#39;re capable of. Defence didn&#39;t  look too ropey and had Edouard been able to find a bit more space (or  control the ball at all) we may have been ahead. What a ball that was  from Moi in behind to Forrest that he didn&#39;t swing his foot at by the  way.<br>
       <br>
       The second half was an abomination. They came out on top and didn&#39;t give  us any chance to control the game because we let them. Broony was  pointless, Rogic faded to obscurity and McGregor barely got near the  ball. It was as if our game plan went out the window and we let them do  anything they fancied.<br>
       <br>
       Elyounoussi shouldn&#39;t have been taken off but Lennon thought the 3-5-2  would open them up more and it didn&#39;t make sense to take anyone else off  with the players that would&#39;ve been left on the field. The limitations  of that tactic against a team who&#39;re able to pass and move above a  rudimentary level came up though and the errors that lead to the first 2  goals are archetypal Celtic in Europe. (there&#39;s no point in discussing  their 3rd)<br>
       <br>
       Simunovic is a liability, Ajer isn&#39;t a right back (or switched on enough  to be CB in that environment) and Taylor wasn&#39;t defensively present  once the 3 at the back was green lit. Poor show from everyone.<br>
       <br>
       Ultimately we&#39;d have been lucky to get any further than the next round  so it doesn&#39;t have a massive bearing on the season but that was the best  chance we&#39;ve had in 16 years to go through to that stage in Europe and  how we lost that game highlights why there was such concern when the  huns were closer to us in the league. We&#39;ve got several mistakes in that  backline (Jozo alone accounted for 6 alone by my count in that 2nd  half) and if there&#39;s a player with quality who finds themselves  benefiting from them we&#39;ll lose matches.<br>
       <br>
       All guns blazing against St Johnstone on Sunday.<br>
      <br>
      (j114 of KDS)<br>
      What is really concerning for me going forward.<br>
       <br>
       That was like the 29th. A well organised hard working team.<br>
       <br>
       Nobody in their team was particularly good or a stand out...they just all did their job.<br>
       <br>
       We need to learn how to play these games better....<br>
       <br>
       Brown when injured just can&rsquo;t be in the team alongside a McGregor who  still struggles when the going gets tough and a Forrest who has been so  off it the last few months I think he needs a couple of weeks sitting on  his arse on the bench.<br>
       <br>
       Individual errors cost us last night.<br>
       <br>
       Simonovic for the first clearly but collectively for the second goal I think 4 players were at fault?!<br>
       <br>
       We are under pressure (which comes back to player 4)...and Jozo hoofs it  into the middle of the park, inexplicably instead of flicking it on or  even leaving it Rogic controls it for 2 Copenhagen players in the middle  of the park.<br>
       Brown then has the chance just to take a booking and get us back in and  regrouped ends up doing nothing...players get away from him because he&rsquo;s  clearly still carrying a knock.<br>
       <br>
       Then where is Taylor? Posted missing sadly.<br>
       <br>
       Shocking goal to lose at this level. Really frustrating<br>

        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Celtic were left to regret  missed opportunities from seven days earlier as they slumped to a  painful first defeat of the decade and crashed unceremoniously out of  the Europa League.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">A  last 32 tie which the Scottish champions should have had all sewn up  had they taken their chances in Denmark last week was ripped from their  grasp by a Copenhagen side who made the most of theirs at Celtic Park.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">On  a night when Neil Lennon&rsquo;s team never really got going, they fell  behind early in the second half to a Michael Santos goal. They looked to  have at least forced extra-time when Odsonne Edouard levelled from a  VAR-awarded penalty but then capitulated in the closing stages as  strikes from Pep Biel and Dame N&rsquo;Doye took Copenhagen into Friday&rsquo;s last  16 draw.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Celtic may well go on to  reaffirm their domestic dominance in Scotland over the next three months  but for now, they are suffering the dismay of failing to join Old Firm  rivals Rangers in the next phase of European competition.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">As  he had hinted on the eve of the match, Lennon&rsquo;s reshuffle of his side  in the absence of the suspended Ryan Christie and injured Olivier Ntcham  saw Tom Rogic handed his first European starting appearance of the  campaign.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">A little  more surprising, perhaps, was the inclusion of Mohamed Elyounoussi as  the on-loan Southampton wide man continues to get back up to full speed  following his recent lay-off.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">But  the Norwegian international was eager to vindicate Lennon&rsquo;s faith in  him and was prominent in most of Celtic&rsquo;s best moments in a first half  which generally saw them struggle to find any sustained fluency.</div>
        <div class="sc-dPPMrM kMHKuJ"></div>
        <div class="sc-hARARD gUFAfA">

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Elyounoussi&rsquo;s  first darting run of the evening off the left flank and into the  Copenhagen penalty area in the ninth minute saw central defender Victor  Nelsson alive to the danger as he made a smart block.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Six  minutes later, a terrific cross from Elyounoussi was only partially  cleared by Pierre Bengtsson. When the ball dropped to Kristoffer Ajer,  his shot was blocked by Guillermo Varela.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">It  was scrappier than Celtic would have liked for lengthy spells and Ajer  put himself under early pressure when he collected the first booking of  the evening for a clumsy foul on Rasmus Falk.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Elyounoussi  continued to catch the eye and he should have put Celtic ahead in the  22nd minute. Another fine run into the penalty area caused confusion in  the Copenhagen defence as he looked to link up with James Forrest. A  weak attempted clearance from Bengtsson saw the ball break invitingly  back into the path of Elyounoussi but he blazed over with the goal at  his mercy.</div>
        <div class="sc-dPPMrM kMHKuJ"></div>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Copenhagen  enjoyed periods of decent possession and carried menace on the counter  attack. It needed an alert interception from Jozo Simunovic to deny Pep  Biel a shooting chance inside the penalty area after slack play in  midfield from the hosts.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">The  visitors were fortunate to survive a scramble of almost comical  proportions inside their six yard box in the 31st minute. Greg Taylor&rsquo;s  cross saw Copenhagen goalkeeper Karl-Johan Johnsson make a fine save to  spare Nelson from an own goal before Rogic&rsquo;s effort from the rebound  struck a post.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Celtic  were finally building up a head of attacking steam as the interval  approached and Edouard was unlucky to see his shot on the turn from  Callum McGregor&rsquo;s cross deflected wide off Nelsson.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Copenhagen  were forced into a chance a minute before half-time when the pacy  Mikkel Kaufmann limped off to be replaced by Santos.</div>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">The  visitors&rsquo; goal enjoyed two lucky escapes in first half stoppage time,  first of all when Elyounoussi failed to force the ball home from a tight  angle after Johnsson had flapped at a deflected shot from Edouard, then  when the French striker was unable to get enough power on a close range  header which the &lsquo;keeper comfortably saved.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Celtic  were left to rue those missed opportunities when Copenhagen stunned the  home support by taking the lead six minutes into the second half.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">The  goal was a calamity for Simunovic who was woefully slack and short with  an attempted pass back to goalkeeper Fraser Forster. The loose ball was  pounced upon by Santos who surged into the penalty area from the right.  He tried to pick out strike partner Dame N&rsquo;Doye with a low cross but  when the ball broke back to him off Christopher Jullien, he displayed  good awareness to loft a shot over Forster into the roof of the net from  around 10 yards.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Celtic  were rattled by the setback and increasingly ragged for a period after  it when Copenhagen appeared capable of increasing their advantage.</div>
        <div class="sc-dPPMrM kMHKuJ"></div>
        <div class="sc-hARARD gUFAfA">

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Lennon  switched to three at the back in a bid to regain the initiative but  Copenhagen continued to look assured. The Celtic boss made his first  substitution of the night with 20 minutes remaining, the tiring  Elyounoussi making way for Leigh Griffiths.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">The  striker was given a rousing reception from the home support as he  joined Edouard up front and he almost made an immediate impact, sniffing  out a chance amid a frantic goalmouth scramble and seeing his shot  brilliantly saved by Johnsson.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Celtic  were running out of both ideas and time but were thrown a lifeline by  Copenhagen defender Ragnar Sigurdsson whose handball as he blocked an  Edouard cross saw VAR invoked and a penalty awarded with seven minutes  remaining.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Edouard  was coolness personified as he dinked the spot kick beyond Johnsson to  relight the atmosphere inside Celtic Park once more.</div>

        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">But  it was almost instantly doused when Copenhagen regained the lead just  two minutes later. More loose play from Celtic allowed Rasmus Falk to  set Pep Biel free in the box and he slotted a low shot under the  advancing Forster.</div>
        <div class="sc-kEmuub sc-bbkauy grUDdz">Crestfallen  Celtic now needed to score twice to win the tie but they were put out  of their misery when Copenhagen added a third of their own in the 88th  minute, N&rsquo;Doye waltzing through the middle to beat Forster with ease.</div>

        By Tom English<br>
        <br>
        BBC Scotland at Celtic Park<br>
        <br>
         From the section Europa League <br>
        Celtic suffered a shock Europa League last-32 exit after three goals in the final seven minutes of a dramatic - and self-inflicted - defeat by Copenhagen.<br>
        <br>
        Neil Lennon&#39;s side seemed set for extra time when Odsonne Edouard coolly dinked in a penalty - awarded for handball after a VAR check - to cancel out Michael Santos&#39; calamitous opener.<br>
        <br>
        But the Danish champions netted twice on the break in the final five minutes - through Pep Biel and Dame N&#39;Doye - to earn a 4-2 aggregate win and mete out Celtic&#39;s first defeat in 2020.<br>
        <br>
        It was a bitterly disappointing night for the Scottish Premiership leaders, who were favourites after a 1-1 draw a week ago, but were architects of their own downfall at Celtic Park.<br>
        <br>
        And it means Rangers will be Scotland&#39;s sole representatives in the next round, with the draw taking place from 12:00 GMT in Nyon on Friday.<br>
        <br>
         Lennon won&#39;t &#39;throw players under bus&#39;<br>
         Test your memory of Celtic&#39;s European run<br>
         Podcast: &#39;Calamitous, catastrophic &amp; shocking&#39;<br>
        <br>
        &#39;Dumped out with almighty thud&#39;<br>
        <br>
        Before the deluge of Celtic errors and Copenhagen goals, the home team had an intensity about them, a tempo in the early minutes that forced the Danes on to the back foot.<br>
        <br>
        It took them 15 minutes to start turning that pressure into chances, but when they did the opportunities flowed. How they were left to rue their wastefulness.<br>
        <br>
        Firstly, James Forrest might have scored had he shown a little more belief at the back post after Mohamed Elyounoussi had swung in a terrific cross. Then, Elyounoussi, after starting the move by ransacking the visitors in his own half, fired over when he should have, at the very least, tested Karl-Johan Johnsson in the Copenhagen goal.<br>
        <br>
        Celtic were slick and menacing. A third moment came and went when Tom Rogic almost scored, the ball bouncing off him in the box and hitting Johnsson&#39;s right-hand post. Edouard had a shot deflected just wide and before the half was up the striker had another effort, a header from point-blank range following a delicious cross from Rogic.<br>
        <br>
        You&#39;d have bet your life on him putting it away, but instead he put it straight at Johnsson. Celtic Park held its head in its hands in angst.<br>
        <br>
        Still, as tidy as Copenhagen looked when trying to counter attack, they hadn&#39;t threatened. Fraser Forster hadn&#39;t a save to make in the opening half. The missed chances would have frustrated them but the lack of menace from the visitors would have enthused Celtic all the same. A false sense of security as it turned out.<br>
        Graphic<br>
        <br>
        Early in the new half, everything changed. It turned out the that greatest threat to Celtic was Celtic themselves - or Jozo Simunovic to be exact. The big defender was guilty of calamitous defending, failing to deal with a routine ball and allowing Santos in to steal it away from him and go in on goal from the right.<br>
        <br>
        Santos, an early substitute, had his pass cut out by a retreating Christopher Jullien, but the loose ball broke back to him and he clipped other Forster to render Celtic Park speechless beyond the euphoria coming from the visiting support.<br>
        <br>
        A relatively comfortable night had suddenly become a crisis. Celtic needed a goal, for extra time, or they were going out. Rogic snapped a low shot wide, a cue for Neil Lennon to send for Leigh Griffiths and go with two up front.<br>
        <br>
        Within two minutes, Griffiths had a magnificent chance after sustained pressure, his shot from on the edge of the six-yard box tipped away by a prone Johnsson, a reflex save that was both stunning and savagely hard to take for the home support.<br>
        <br>
        The stress was tangible now, but it lifted when Sigurdsson was done for handball by VAR and Edouard clipped the coolest penalty past Johnsson. The class and impudence of the striker sent Celtic Park into raptures.<br>
        <br>
        With eight minutes left, the impetus was with Celtic. The relief evaporated quickly. More awful decision-making did for them again with Copenhagen&#39;s second, Jullien and then Rogic getting their side into trouble in the first instance. The visitors countered and it was devastating, Biel put through on Forster and finishing brilliantly.<br>
        <br>
        That as good as put Celtic out, but any prospect of a miraculous endgame was snuffed out with a third goal.<br>
        <br>
        Again, Celtic were did themselves grievous damage. Kristoffer Ajer this time making a poor clearance before N&#39;Doye went straight to score the goal that humbled the Scottish champions and dumped them out of Europe with an almighty thud.<br>
        Man of the match - Pep Biel<br>
        Pep Biel&#39;s goal with five minutes left effectively killed the tie<br>
        Clever and influential in the second half, the Spanish midfielder caused Celtic problems with his hustling and harrying and rounded it off with that decisive second goal. The real killer<br>
        Match stats<br>
        <br>
         Celtic are winless in their last five European games against Danish opponents (D2 L3)<br>
         Copenhagen scored three times away from home in a European game (excl. qualifiers) for the first time since December 2009 (3-0 v Sparta Prague)<br>
         Celtic made it three European games without a win (D1 L2), after winning six of the seven before that, including qualifiers (D1)<br>
         Edouard has been directly involved in five Europa League goals this season (3 goals and 2 assists), more than any other Celtic player<br>
         Copenhagen scored with all three of their shots on target - all coming in the second half.<br>
        <br>
        What does this mean for the coefficient?<br>
        <br>
        Had Celtic gone through, two Scottish sides would have been guaranteed places in the Champions League qualifiers the season after next.<br>
        <br>
        However, Copenhagen&#39;s win means Denmark replace Scotland in 13th place in the rankings - with the top 15 nations gaining two places in Europe&#39;s premier club competition.<br>
        <br>
        Only Greece and Switzerland can prevent Scotland finishing 14th, and both Olympiakos and Basel would have to reach the business end of the Europa League to do that.<br>
        <br>
        And, of course, should Rangers fare better than Copenhagen in the last 16, Scotland may well edge above Denmark again.
