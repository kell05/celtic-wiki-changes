    A letter was read from the Celtic complaining of the conduct of the spectators at Paisley during their match with the Abercorn. The conduct of the spectators, it stated was about the worst their team had ever experienced. The execrable oaths and blasphemies yelled by the crowd were simply indescribable. At the close of the game the spectators rushed on the field, and the Celtic players were assailed with all sorts of vile epithets by the crowd, and were otherwise severely assaulted. (Laughter) The Abercorn secretary asked that the matter should be delayed until he could get information, and this was agreed to, the matter being held over until the next meeting of the Committee on 4th April.<br>

    S.F.A. Committee. - The Celtic wrote a strong letter complaining of the way they had been treated at Paisley when playing the Abercorn there on 11th February. The Abercorn replied that they had not received sufficient time to prepare their defence, and it was ultimately agreed to postpone the matter until next meeting. <br>
