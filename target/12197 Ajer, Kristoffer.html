    &quot;He has everything a top defender should have. He&rsquo;s got decent pace, he&rsquo;s good in the air and he&rsquo;s strong. He started off in midfield so he&rsquo;s comfortable on the ball. He definitely has everything to really progress at this club.&quot;<b><br>

      &quot;For me, I&#39;ve always thought that Scottish fans are the best in the  world in terms of creating an incredible atmosphere and fantastic noise.  Without a doubt, this is one of the best countries in the world to play  in for atmosphere.&quot;</div>

      &quot;He&#39;s an outstanding footballer all round. He doesn&#39;t see himself as a defender. He thinks he&#39;s Franz Beckenbauer at times, but he&#39;s got some great attributes. He was cool as a cucumber.&quot;</div>

    <div>KRISTOFFER AJER reckons taking a step back into defence will see him make giant strides forward at Celtic.<br>
      <br>
      When the Hoops snapped up one of Norwegian football&rsquo;s hottest prospects, Ajer had made his name as a midfielder.<br>
      <br>
      The talented teenager had already captained his club IK Start as a 16-year-old &ndash; the youngest ever to do so in the Tippeligaen &ndash; when he agreed a four-year deal with Ronny Deila at Celtic in February 2016.<br>
      <br>
      Now though, under the guidance of Deila&rsquo;s Celtic successor Brendan Rodgers, 6ft 5in Ajer is flourishing in the heart of defence and impressed in the first-half of the Hoops&rsquo; friendly defeat to Lyon at Parkhead on Saturday.<br>
      <br>
      Ajer admits learning from Kolo Toure and Erik Sviatchenko followed by a loan spell at Kilmarnock in the second half of last season brought his game on leaps and bounds and the 19-year-old is comfortable in his new role.<br>
      <br>
      Ajer said: &ldquo;I had a really good chat with the gaffer when I came here about my position.<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I am now a centre-half. I always knew that would happen one day, but in Norway I was a midfielder as that was the best place for me to develop at that stage of my career.<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;But now it&rsquo;s better for me to focus on that defensive role and work on developing there. <br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I have learned a lot in the last year.<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;For the first six months, it was great working with the gaffer and learning from the top players here, then I had six months at Kilmarnock and that went well so I feel like I have improved as a player.<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I have worked on my positioning and how the gaffer wanted to play out from the back and my timing in the tackle is better. <br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I feel much more in control of where I need to be when we don&rsquo;t have the ball and are defending. I feel a lot more comfortable as a central defender.<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I learned a lot over six months at Celtic and the other centre halves were really good with me &ndash; Kolo Toure was a massive help as was Erik Sviatchenko.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      Ajer played in the heart of a makeshift Celtic defence that managed to keep Lyon at bay before the break &ndash; new &pound;4.5 million signing Olivier Ntcham also made an impressive start.<br>
      <br>
      Rodgers had rested the entire starting 11 that beat Linfield 2-0 at Windsor Park on Friday and in the second half Lyon ruthlessly exposed a young Hoops side with Maxwel Cornet, Myziane Maolida, Nabil Fekir and Amine Gouiri completing a 4-0 win.<br>
      <br>
      Celtic will be back at full-strength when Linfield come calling on Wednesday night and Celtic should progress to the Champions League third qualifying round to face either Rosenborg or Dundalk &ndash; who drew 1-1 in midweek.<br>
      <br>
      Ajer knows if favourites Rosenborg prevail then the Hoops will have a tough test against his countrymen.<br>
      <br>
      He said: &ldquo;First, we have an important game against Linfield on Wednesday, we did well over there and now must make sure we go through. Rosenborg also have to get through but they are a good team who have done well in Norway.<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;They will be a good opponent. They have strong attacking players who are good on the ball.<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;The league is quite strong but it&rsquo;s not that physical compared to here.<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I learned a lot on that side when I came here from guys like Broony, in terms of how to go into duels and win them.<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;Celtic are a huge club with brilliant fans and a great history, while Rosenborg are in the biggest club in my country so it would really get a lot of attention.&rdquo;<br>

    <h3>Celtic kid Kristoffer Ajer was destined for the top after being made captain of IK Start aged just sixteen</h3>
    <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/celtic-kid-kristoffer-ajer-destined-11792223<br>
         Former team-mate Jesper Mathisen reveals how maturity of Hoops star from an early age made it clear he would be able to handle life in Scotland&#39;s top flight.<br>
         <br>
         Kristoffer Ajer might have been a fresh-faced youngster but everyone in Norway saw him as a natural born leader right from the Start.<br>
         <br>
         The Celtic youngster came through his Old Firm debut with rave reviews last weekend and is set to be rewarded with his first call up to the Norway senior side.<br>
         <br>
         <br>
         No one in his homeland is surprised as the Scandinavians have been convinced the 19-year-old was destined for the big time since day one and see him as their great defensive hope.<br>
         <br>
         Ajer&rsquo;s had to bide his time at Parkhead but he was a sensation in Norway. He was a star at IK Start as a kid and was even made captain at 16 the youngest player to skipper a side in the Norwegian top division.<br>
         <br>
         Ajer has started to become a regular in the Celtic squad this season <br>
         <br>
         Former team-mate Jesper Mathisen, who is now a pundit with TV2 in Norway, knew immediately Ajer was ahead of his time.<br>
         <br>
         The former Start defender said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never met an older 16 year-old! He was young but he was so mature on and off the pitch.<br>
         <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">He&rsquo;s one of my closest friends from that time. There are 11 years between us but that shows how mature he is. He&rsquo;s like an old man!<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">That&rsquo;s why he was captain at just 16. It was a huge moment for him. The people around the club thought it was a bit weird at the time.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Some were negative. They felt it was putting even more pressure on young shoulders, especially as it was against his old club Lillestrom.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">But everyone inside the club had seen how he trained and it was no big deal for them. He was the leader in the dressing room even then.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         Kristoffer Ajer during his time at IK Start <br>
         <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">He decided he wanted to be the best player he could possibly be and was the first player in the dressing room and the last one to leave. The other players understood they had to step up.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Of course there were more experienced players, some with hundreds of matches in the Norwegian league but the way he worked and prepared for matches was a new standard. The players accepted it. They said, &lsquo;okay, he&rsquo;s young but he&rsquo;s a special player&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         Mathisen was in Glasgow to visit his pal for last month&rsquo;s Champions League clash with Anderlecht and has kept close tabs on Ajer&rsquo;s progress.<br>
         <br>
         He tuned in for the Old Firm showdown and heard BBC pundit Pat Nevin comparing the kid to &pound;50m Manchester City defender Jon Stones.<br>
         <br>
         Mathison agrees. He&rsquo;s convinced Ajer is at the ideal club to develop and believes his buddy will kick on to become a mainstay at the heart of the defences for club and country &ndash; before eventually following in the footsteps of record-breaking former Celt Virgil van Dijk and cracking the English Premier League.<br>
         <br>
         The pundit &ndash; whose IK Start legend dad Svien had a short spell at Hibs in the 70s &ndash; said: &ldquo;It was a big deal he was given the chance by Brendan Rodgers in such a huge match.<br>
         <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">For a young lad from Norway he should have been nervous playing in the biggest game for the fans and the players.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">But while there were some small problems, he dealt with them and was one of Celtic&rsquo;s best players.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">I can see why Nevin compared him to a young Jon Stones. It was a massive compliment but you can see similar styles. Kristoffer will continue to get better.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Many young players when they break through they are happy but he will continue to train harder than anyone.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Kristoffer is at a big club but he can go even bigger one day. I also know he loves being at Celtic. I can see why when you see the stadium and 60,000 fans every other week.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">And when you look at what has happened with Virgil van Dijk, it&rsquo;s a great path he is going down. There is no doubt Kristoffer will play in the Premier League in the future but he is in the perfect place for the next couple of years.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">In Norway we hope he will be the new leader for the national team.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">We have not had someone like that in defence since Brede Hangeland retired. The way he is developing is fantastic for him, for Celtic and for the Norway team.&rdquo;<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         Lars Lagerback is set to hand Ajer his first call-up to the Norway senior squad <br>
         <br>
         Ajer&rsquo;s old gaffer takes pride in seeing his prodigy progress.<br>
         <br>
         Former Start boss Mons Ivar Mjelde admitted he was lucky the lanky lad landed on his doorstep after deciding to leave Lillestrom to be closer to his family in the south of Norway.<br>
         <br>
         But he saw the potential and chucked the kid in to his side at just 16 and quickly made him skipper.<br>
         <br>
         Mjelde saw so much talent he played him as an attacking-midfielder but he was convinced the youngster would eventually flourish at the back.<br>
         <br>
         The gaffer &ndash; now in charge at Asane &ndash; said: &ldquo;Kristoffer had so much ability he could play anywhere.<br>
         <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">In the first half of the season he was our top scorer. He maybe didn&rsquo;t have the speed to play those forward positions at the very top level but he could do so in Norway.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">It&rsquo;s natural for him to move towards the back because he was is clever on the ball and can read the play.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         Brendan Rodgers has been showing more and more faith in Ajer this season <br>
         <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">I&rsquo;m very happy to see him develop at Celtic. The manager has been very smart with him, sending him on loan to learn more about playing in defence, and now he is back he is getting better and better. His potential is huge. <br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">He is a very modern defender. You see the way he plays, he&rsquo;s not afraid to attack with the ball from the back.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">He is strong in the air and in the tackle but he has the ability on the ball that is so important in the modern game.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">I was sure immediately he was going to go far in the game and go to to become a Norway international. I knew IK Start was just the beginning for him.<br>
    </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br>
         </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">You never know where he will end up but he is continuing to make great progress and I am delighted for him.&rdquo;<br>
