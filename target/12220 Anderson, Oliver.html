    <br>
    Anderson had just inspired Arthurlie to a 5-1 Scottish Junior Cup final triumph over Rob Roy - he had netted twice from the penalty spot in the match at Celtic Park - and was a wanted man with several senior clubs keen to secure his services (&quot;<i>like wasps around a honey jar</i>&quot;). His mother was said to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown.<br>
    <br>
    Glasgow-born Anderson chose Celtic, and the hoops sent a team to play the junior club on 26 August 1937 as part of the transfer deal, and it was said: <br>
    <blockquote>&quot;<i>By all the laws, Anderson should come up to the top by leaps and bounds.</i>&quot;<br>
    </blockquote>
       
    <div>  <br>
      <div>  </div>
        
      <div>  He eventually made his first team debut in a 1-0 loss at home to Queens Park on 3rd January <a href="/page/1939" target="_self">1939</a>, but oen report was positive on his performance stating: <i><br>
        </i>
        <blockquote><i>&quot;Both [Anderson &amp; O&#39;Neil] showed promise of fitting into the Parkhead scheme in the not-too-distant future&quot;. (The Glasgow Herald)</i><br>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        He went on to make 11 appearances that season - hitting his first goal in a 3-1 win at home to Clyde on 11th Feb 1939, which was possibly a bit lucky:<br>
        <blockquote>  <i>&quot;Anderson from 15 yards out, lobbed the ball right over the Brown&rsquo;s head, and the impression was that the winger did not try to score himself. His delivery looked as if it was meant for a cross to the far post.&quot; (The Glasgow Herald)</i><br>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        He also scored v Motherwell in a 3-2 win, with a header v Queen&#39;s Park in a 2-1 win and scored the equaliser v Kilmarnock in a 1-1 draw, beating three men before smashing a 20-yard shot past their keeper.<br>
        <br>
        However, war was soon to intervene and Anderson was drafted into the Royal Artillery on 1st August 1939, amongst the first draft of men under the Militia Training Act. <br>
        <br>
        It wasn&#39;t until December 1939 that Celtic &#39;paid him off&#39; (as in made him a free agent for the duration of the war) along with others due to the change in circumstances cause of the war, but he had only played a few games in the past season. He had complained that he was never given the chance to settle in one position, that he was every manager&#39;s handyman. <br>
        <br>
        Celtic were poorly managed at this time both on &amp; off the field, and so the golden promise of Oliver Anderson appears to have been lost; as Celtic were abject through this time, it was another opportunity squandered but in fairness the war had begun and everything was in flux.<br>
        <br>
        Celtic still retained his registration until 1946 although his career at Parkhead was all but over after just 16 league appearances. Records show he still made a one-off appearance  in season 1940/41 in a league match for Celtic against St Mirren in a  0-0 draw, but also played in Celtic reserves on 15 Jan 1944 before action with his anti-tank unit in France.<br>
        <br>
        He was to play for the SFA XI v the Army in Galashiels on 16 March 1940, with a note on him that:<br>
        <blockquote>&quot;<i>[he has] filled out... his play is a lot more purposeful than it used to be.</i>&quot;<br>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        He was drafted in France in Sep 1944 and was injured but bravely was said to say: <br>
        <blockquote>&quot;<i>I got a bullet through the calf of my leg but that isn&#39;t going to stop me playing!</i>&quot;<br>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <div><br>
        He went in as a private and emerged as a second lieutenant. <br>
        <br>
        During hostilities he guested for several sides in the regional league competitions (e.g. Clyde, Morton, Third Lanark) and despite the aforementioned shot in the leg during fighting in France, Anderson&#39;s football career continued after the war as he went on to play for the likes of Airdrie, <a href="/page/Falkirk" target="_self">Falkirk</a>, Cowdenbeath and Arbroath.He also had trials with Third Lanark (1947), Ards (1950) and Kilmarnock (1951).<br>
