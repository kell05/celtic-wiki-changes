        <b><br>
          Q Will you return to Celtic park as a fan ?</b><br>
        A Yes. Definitely.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Q Have you watched a replay of Seville ?</b><br>
        A No, nothing, No highlights, nothing at all. I have the DVD in the house and when the family move down South in the Summer I plan on sitting down with them and re-living the experience. Until now it has been just too painful.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Q What was MONs teamtalk before Seville ?</b><br>
        A Y&#39;know, I can&#39;t remember. It was such a high energy occassion. I remember he had us absolutely high as a kite before the game at Anfield but now I can&#39;t remember a word he said !! Whatever it was, it was great.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Q Favourite Celt on and off the park.</b><br>
        A Two players for that one. Henrik and Sutty. Great players and good mates.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Q Best dressing room prank.</b><br>
        A What, that I&#39;ve done ?<br>
        <b>Q whatever, you or anyone, what was the best ?</b><br>
        A Nothing in particular springs to mind other than when we were celebrating winning the League. Anyone within distance wearing a decent suit was always targeted to be covered in anything we might have handy. Champagne, beer, shampoo, you name it.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Q Sum up an Old Firm match</b><br>
        A Oh, that&#39;s a toughie. My memories are more good than bad but i always felt truly privelaged to pla in them. I would look forward to those games for weeks. They would be marked on the calendar. I was always up for them an the buzz was just unbelievable.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Q Would you recommend Celtic to a fellow Pro ??</b><br>
        A Without a shadow of a doubt. Top, top club.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Q Which youngster do you rate ?</b><br>
        A Simon Ferry. He has everything you need to make it in the game.<br>
        <b>Q You watched a lot of youth and reserve games.</b><br>
        A Yes, an I also trained with them !! <br>
        <br>
        <b>Q Favourite goal scored</b><br>
        A The last minute shot against Rangers. One, becuase it was in the last minute, two, because it was against Rangers and three, because it bent round Ricksen on the way in.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Q Do you wish you HAD nutted Lovenkrands ?</b><br>
