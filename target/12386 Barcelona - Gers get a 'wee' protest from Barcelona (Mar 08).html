      <font size="3">BARCELONA residents were so outraged by the behaviour of Rangers fans in their city that they sent bottles of urine to the club, a Spanish newspaper revealed yesterday.</font><br>
       <br>
      <font size="3">Sports Gers fans were pictured urinating on statues and trees as more than 700 went on the rampage when they were knocked out of the Champions League at the Nou Camp last November.</font><br>

      <font size="3">The fans were baton charged by police, but none were arrested.</font><br>
       <br>
      <font size="3">In protest, a group calling themselves the Urine Therapy and Citizens Platform, sent bottles labelled &quot;Natural Catalan Pissade&quot; and &quot;Peeing: Barcelona vintage 2007&quot;, to Ibrox.</font><br>
