        <li><b>Midweek league match,</b> full set of matches played tonight (except Hibs v Hearts played last night, Hearts 3-1 victors)</li>
        <li><b>Sevco lose to Hamilton</b> at Ibrox, so Celtic now 13pts in front (Sevco have game in hand).</li>
        <li><b>Celtic were lucky</b> in that Livvie were ahead 2-1 for almost entire second half, and put up a great defensive display. Celtic were not at the races but managed to scrape a draw.</li>
        <li>Matches played concurrently (Celtic game on TV), and so worked as Celtic ahead, Livvie draw, Livvie go ahead then Hamilton score, all square then Celtic equalise at the death, and the Sevco hopes to pull back the league pts defecit is ended, as is likely the league title opportunity.</li>
        <li><b>Neil Lennon </b>praised both the mental and physical strength of his Celtic players as they bounced back from their Europa League exit to keep their bid for a fourth consecutive domestic treble on course.</li>
        <li>Neil Lennon insists he doesn&rsquo;t blame Jozo Simunovic for Celtic&rsquo;s exit from Europe, saying the centre-back has and will be absent from the team due to a knee problem.</li>
        <li><b>Ex-Celt Wanyama</b> has moved to Canada to the MLS. Good luck to him, some say a waste he&rsquo;s leaving for the MLS at just 28 when he has still so much to offer. Celtic hoped to get him on loan but too expensive.</li>
        <li>Former Celtic loan striker <b>Timothy Weah </b>ruled out until the end of the French league season because of injury. We wish him a speedy recovery.</li>
        <li>SFA and SPFL have joined forces to respond if they have to take action amid an outbreak of the <b>coronavirus</b>. The first case of the deadly illness in Scotland was confirmed on Sunday after a patient from Tayside tested positive following a recent trip to Italy. Matches in the Italian top flight have been cancelled due to the outbreak of the illness and similar measures could be taken in Scotland if the virus spreads.</li>
        <li>Celtic are set to host a charity football match alongside former <b>Scottish rugby star Doddie Weir</b> organised in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND). Doddie Weir has been suffering from MND, the same condition that sadly led to the premature death of Celtic&rsquo;s Jimmy Johnstone &amp; Sevco&rsquo;s Fernando Ricksen.</li>
        <li>Reports: Celtic are set to <b>strike a deal with </b><b>Adidas </b>that will eclipse their record &pound;25m five-year agreement with New Balance, becoming the biggest kit contract in Scottish football history. The Hoops were rumoured to be joining forces with the sportswear firm last year.</li>

    <div>(JBC of TheCelticWiki)</div>
    <div>With all sides (bar Hearts/Hibs) playing concurrently, this was like old days with people score watching other games whilst watchign this one.<br>
      <br>
      The day then turned into an eventful one, with an early Celtic lead seeming to close out the day with only further scores to prove the gap between Celtic the rest. The Celtic goal was a screamer again by McGregor aided by a mistake by ex-Celt Ambrose. However, Livvie to their credit didn&#39;t read the script and a first disputed goal (foul of goalkeeper &amp; from a fould throw) turned things around and went into the lead.<br>
      <br>
      The Celtic back three is not a working tactic, and Julien in particular had a bad game. Celtic were saved with Hamilton taking a very surprise lead v Sevco away, and held out to win for only their second time at Ibrox. Celtic managed to salvagae a point at the end, which was the least that Celtic deserved.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>In the short-term, the least that Celtic got was a pt on the road to the league title, but in a bigger picture a lot more work on tactics etc needs done. Some players are off key and there is a huge over reliance on some like Brown &amp; Edouard.<br>
      <br>
      At least we can all laugh at Sevco, their season is truly over now domestically.</div>
    <div></div>
    (CB 1967 of KDS)<br>
    Pish in the first half where the pitch was worst for us offensively.<br>
     <br>
     Better in the second half - Reality is we are not burying our chances -  Same as Copenhagen on Thursday night - Put even some of them away and we  win the games easily enough - McGregor should have scored in the first  half - Second half today we had 2/3 attempts by Forrest - Eddie poor  hit from the edge of the box and then a brilliant flick onto the post -  Christie 2/3 chances - We did more than enough on a crap pitch to win  it and ended up winning by a cross into the box.<br>
     <br>
     Only important thing after Thursday is that we won.<br>
     <br>
     Taylor very poor as was Griffiths.<br>
     <br>
     Eddie recently showing signs that carrying the frontline for half a  season on his own has caught up with him a bit and he has not quite got  his edge just now - Any replay would have been Wednesday 11th in the run  up to the zombies game so fortunately after Livi and St.Mirren he will  now have a week before the Midden.<br>
     <br>
     Anyways as others have said result was ground out but we got there and quadruple treble is on so all good.<br>

    <h3>Livingston 2 - 2 Celtic: Rogic late leveller means champions extend lead at the top</h3>
    Hosts come from behind to deliver Celtic third defeat of the season<br>
    By Andrew Smith<br>
    Wednesday, 4th March 2020, 10:18 pm<br>
    Updated<br>
    13 hours ago<br>
    https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/celtic/livingston-2-2-celtic-rogic-late-leveller-means-champions-extend-lead-top-2072438<br>
    Celtic may have stretched their Premiership lead to a surely unassailable 13 points but that should not take away from a Livingston display that stretched them to breaking point.<br>
    <br>
    In the final analysis, the injury-time equaliser from Tom Rogic that &ndash; coupled with Hamilton&rsquo;s win at Ibrox &ndash; gives the champions a planet-sized cushion in their march to a ninth straight title meant honours even in all respects at the Tony Macaroni stadium.<br>
    <br>
    Celtic&rsquo;s unwillingness to give up a five-month unbeaten run away from home in domestic competition deserved the reward that came from Odsonne Edouard gliding down the left channel to square for the Australian attacker to sweep in with the help of a deflection. Yet, Gary Holt&rsquo;s men deserved tangible reward from an engrossing encounter for their tenacity in repelling a late siege, never mind for the fact they held the lead for an entire 45 minutes after recovering from the loss of an early Callum McGregor goal. They mistakes they forced through their sheer force of will to strike back through Jon Guthrie and Scott Robinson might easily have brought up a winning double over a team that had won 19 of their previous 20 league games.<br>
    <br>
    The Livingston display meant the level of apprehension Celtic held going into the game was well founded - even allowing for the fact that they were seeking a 15th straight away victory in all domestic competitions. It could be no other way when memories of the last time they failed to win on the road in Scotland were stirred by their return to the scene of that defeat.<br>
    <br>
    The genuine challenge Gary Holt&rsquo;s men are mounting for one of the European places has shown that their 2-0 win over Celtic in October was simply in keeping with the discomfort they are capable of inflicting on any opponents on their artificial surface.<br>
    <br>
    Livingston were seeking an eighth straight home win in a nine-game unbeaten run within their own environs, while Celtic &ndash; as Lennon acknowledged pre-match &ndash; had not scored in either of their visits to the ground since the hosts regained top-flight status.<br>
    <br>
    Celtic exhibited a drive and aggression early on and, for all that the plastic pitch in West Lothian can engender football that can appear as synthetic as its materials, the visitors worked the ball around to tease openings with impressive intent in those opening stages. Yet, Livingston are not shaken off easily and after slowly working their way into the encounter, it was the home side that drew the first save of the evening, with Fraser Forster forced to push a Guthrie skimmer round the post.<br>
    <br>
    It was to prove the precursor, though, to home keeper Robby McCrorie, on loan from Rangers, having an inauspicious role in Celtic&rsquo;s 16th-minute opener. McGregor certainly got whip and curl on an knuckle-ball hit from the edge of the box after he shifted neatly from left to right, but it was strange to see McCrorie flummoxed by a shot that crossed the line in a middling area.<br>
    <br>
    Yet, whatever the Livingston keeper&rsquo;s shortcomings on that occasion, they were knocked into a cocked hat by the blunder from his opposite number Forster that gifted the home side an equaliser eight minutes later.<br>
    <br>
    The long throw in the hands of Livingston is a formidable weapon, and one that Celtic became increasingly troubled by last night. That doesn&rsquo;t explain how the on-loan Southampton keeper simply dropped the ball that he came to claim after it was hoisted in by Ciaron Brown. It didn&rsquo;t tell the whole story of the goal that ensued, though, with Guthrie alert and accurate to hook in with his back to goal.<br>
    <br>
    As Livingston forced Celtic into an arm wrestle that made the confrontation swing back and forth, Lennon&rsquo;s men sought to step it up, and Edouard smacked the inside of the post appraoching an interval of an enthralling tussle.<br>
    <br>
    It became all the more so when 50 seconds into the second period, the home team induced Celtic into further defensive calamity. It is easy to merely focus on Livingston&rsquo;s drive and desire when assessing their remarkable competitiveness, but they took the lead last night through speed of thought and movement as well as muscle. Jullien may have sold himself and fell to the ground to allow Dykes to speed away from him after latching on to a ball thumped down the left but his cut-back was pristine and so was the finish from Scott Robinson that followed. Incredibly, it was only the player&rsquo;s second goal of the season after his first came in the early season victory over Celtic.<br>
    <br>
    Lennon&rsquo;s men may have made the running thereafter, but the two teams traded chances. An erratic clearance from Jullien led to ****&rsquo;s curling just over seconds before defending of the first order resulted in Edouard, through on goal, being denied by a superb last-ditch tackle from Guthrie. That Livingston could not hold out - despite the excellence of Guthrie and former Celtic defender Efe Ambrose on his home debut- should not detract from a herculean effort from the home side.<br>

    <h3>Neil Lennon hails &#39;outstanding&#39; Celtic despite needing last-minute leveller at Livingston</h3>
    Parkhead boss proud of players as they fought back to claim point<br>

    Celtic manager Neil Lennon spoke of the honour he derives from the efforts of his players as they took another step towards a ninth straight title despite requiring a 92nd-minute Tom Rogic equaliser to draw 2-2 at Livingston.<br>
    <br>
    Lennon lauded the endeavours of his men in extending their Premiership advantage to 13 points over a Rangers side last night beaten at home to Hamilton, declaring that, to a man, they were &ldquo;brilliant&rdquo;. &ldquo;It is a privilege for me to manage this team,&rdquo; he said.<br>
    <br>
    The Celtic manager had no truck with any suggestion that his team had struggled against opponents that took a 46th lead through Scott Robinson after Jon Guthrie had cancelled out a Callum McGregor opener, focusing on the last half hour &ldquo;battering&rdquo; his team dished out in search of response.<br>

    <br>
    &ldquo;I am delighted with the performance,&rdquo; he said of a draw at the only Scottish ground outside of Celtic Park where they have previously lost this season. &ldquo;I thought we deserved all three points. I was disappointed with the manner of their goals. Their first could have been a foul on Fraser [Forster], the second was poor from our point of view - but the rest of the game we were magnificent. Against a difficult opponent on a difficult pitch we were absolutely outstanding and I had total belief we could get an equaliser and Tom came up with the goods.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Livingston were hanging on and we broke them and we got the very least that we deserved. We dominated for long, long period and I&rsquo;m sitting here disappointed at the first points we have dropped in 2020.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Lennon shutdown any suggestion of the title race being over courtesy of the huge lead held by his team with only nine Premiership games remaining.<br>

    &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking about that. I&rsquo;m taking it game by game and we have St Mirren on Saturday,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t be giving away sloppy goals. You don&rsquo;t want to be chasing games. We set high standards for us and that&rsquo;s the first points we&rsquo;ve dropped in 2020 but in the context of the evening I suppose [it was good]. It was always going to be a tough fixture but the way we played pleased me more than anything. We were brilliant, we were relentless. That&rsquo;s why I am disappointed we did not win.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Livingston offered anything other than long throws and the odd breakaway. We were very entertaining and very good and I&rsquo;m pleased to get a point.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Opposite number Gary Holt refused to see the loss of an injury-time eqaliser as ruining a valiant display by his team. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m buzzing,&rdquo; the Livingston manager said. &ldquo;To a man, they were excellent and I couldn&#39;t have asked for more from them. They are disappointed, but I told them to lift their heads up because we are really proud of them. It is a great point. We could have won the game, but at the same time, we could have lost it.&rdquo;

    <br>
    BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena<br>
    <br>
     From the section Scottish Premiership<br>
    <br>
    Highlights: Livingston 2-2 Celtic<br>
    <br>
    Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic averted a first domestic defeat of 2020 after Tom Rogic&#39;s stoppage-time goal snatched a draw at Livingston to move them 13 points clear.<br>
    <br>
    Livingston had looked like earning an unlikely double against the champions - and an eighth home win in a row - after Scott Robinson and Jon Guthrie cancelled out Callum McGregor&#39;s strike.<br>
    <br>
    But Rogic struck to earn the point that edges Neil Lennon&#39;s side further clear of Rangers, who were beaten at home by Hamilton Academical.<br>
    <br>
    It was the first time in 12 domestic games that Celtic have failed to win and the second time this season that they have been unable to do so at the Tony Macaroni, after losing 2-0 there in October.<br>
    <br>
    Gary Holt&#39;s Livingston, meanwhile, are now six points off third-place Motherwell.<br>
    <br>
     Celtic relentless &amp; breathtaking - Lennon<br>
     Reaction &amp; as it happened<br>
    <br>
    Familiar story as Dykes causes problems<br>
    <br>
    Livingston&#39;s victory over Celtic in October formed the narrative ahead of this game. It was the only defeat Lennon&#39;s side have suffered on the road in the Premiership this season.<br>
    <br>
    It was the manner of the 2-0 victory that lingered, Livingston&#39;s forwards - Lyndon Dykes in particular - giving the likes of Christopher Jullien a torrid early introduction to life in the Scotland&#39;s top flight.<br>
    <br>
    Celtic would seize the early initiative this time, though. McGregor collected the ball at the edge of the area, and the Scotland midfielder lashed home to make it 1-0. It was a superb strike.<br>
    <br>
    But Livingston know how to cause mayhem from long throws. Ciaron Brown hurled the ball toward goal, Fraser Forster came for it but failed to get enough of a fist on the ball and it fell to Guthrie, who hooked it over his shoulder for his fifth of the season.<br>
    <br>
    Celtic would create further first-half chances. Jullien headed over from a Ryan Christie free-kick, then Odsonne Edouard struck an upright after a McGregor burst.<br>

    <br>
    But, like in October, Dykes would give Jullien major problems as the second half began. The Australian striker drove into the box, leaving the defender trailing in his wake, and cut the ball back for Robinson to crash past Forster.<br>
    <br>
    Celtic would throw the kitchen sink at Livingston without carving open the well-drilled home side. For most of the next 15 minutes, the champions were camped outside the penalty area.<br>
    <br>
    But a poor backpass from Jullien would allow nemesis Dykes the chance to drive through the middle this time, only for the striker to loop his shot wide.<br>
    <br>
    Almost immediately after that, Edouard burst through for Celtic, but his low effort was deflected wide. Eventually Leigh Griffiths was thrown into the fray against his old club, who were by now holding on as stoutly as they could against incessant Celtic attacks.<br>
    <br>
    But eventually the pressure would tell as substitute Rogic&#39;s deflected shot found the net to rescue a point.<br>
    Man of the match - Lyndon Dykes<br>
    <br>
    The Livingston striker gave the Celtic defenders a torrid time in October and did the same again in front of watching Australia assistant coach Rene Meulensteen.<br>
    <br>
    Direct, strong, swaggering - a big impact player who appears to be getting better and better.<br>
    &#39;The response was everything we expected&#39; - reaction<br>
    Livingston &#39;excellent to a man&#39; in Celtic draw - Holt<br>
    <br>
    Livingston manager Gary Holt: &quot;I am over the moon. To a man, they were excellent and I couldn&#39;t have asked for more from them.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;They are disappointed, but I told them to lift their heads up because we are really proud of them. It is a great point.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Celtic manager Neil Lennon: &quot;I thought we were outstanding. We absolutely battered them in the second half and a draw was the least we deserved.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The response from the team was everything we expected of them. Some of the speed of the play was breathtaking.&quot;<br>
