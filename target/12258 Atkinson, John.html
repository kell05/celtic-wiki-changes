    <div>Outside-left John Atkinson enjoyed a brief but remarkably successful Celtic career hitting two goals in his only league appearance for the Bhoys which helped guide the first team to the league title.<br>
      <br>
      A backlog of fixtures saw championship-chasing Celtic having to play 8 games in 11 days during the climax of the <a href="/page/1909" target="_self">1908-09</a> season. During this arduous run-in the Bhoys suffered a blow when on 21st April 1909, Celtic&#39;s key player Davie Hamilton was injured in a 1-1 draw with Hamilton Accies which meant he was unfit to face Morton the next day.<br>
      <br>
      The Accies agreed to loan Cambuslang-born amateur John Atkinson to Celtic for the occasion, whereupon he produced a great display to score twice in a 5-1 victory v Morton at Celtic Park. This was allowed  because <a href="/page/Atkinson%2C+John" target="_self">John Atkinson</a> was an amateur player.<br>
      <br>
      Celtic won five of their eleven games and took their fifth-straight league title by a point from Dundee, but sadly John didn&#39;t play in any more of these games. <br>
      <br>
      As Celtic won the title by the slimmest of margins, just 1pt ahead of  Dundee, then every point counted and every contribution mattered, so  John Atkinson could look back proudly on playing his part in this campaign for Celtic.<br>
      <br>
      He went on to qualify as a doctor in Oct 1910, obtained a practise in NE England (Co Durham) and was still playing football in North East England in 1912. <br>
      <br>
      He later travelled abroad, working in Madagascar.</div>
    <div><br>
      Tragically on 26 November 1914, at the age of 29, he drowned in an accident off the west coast of Africa.</div>

    <div>John Atkinson, born at Cambuslang on 5 December 1884, was an outside-left who made four appearances for Queen&rsquo;s Park in season 1904/05, but it was with Hamilton Academical that he spent most of his career. In 97 league matches, Atkinson scored 27 goals. <br>
      <br>
      He made one appearance for Celtic on 22 April 1909, and scored two goals as Celtic thrashed Morton 5-1. It was a kind gesture by Accies to loan him to Celtic, as the usual Celtic outside-left, David Hamilton, had been injured in the match between the two sides the previous day. Celtic had a fixture backlog and play eight times in 11 days! <br>
      <br>
      Partick Thistle took him for a month or so in March 1910, and thereafter he qualified as a Doctor and practiced in County Durham until the outbreak of war. He then travelled abroad, working in Madagascar. Tragically on 26 November 1914, at the age of 29, he drowned in an accident off the west coast of Africa.</div>
