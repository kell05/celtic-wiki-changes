            </font>The black &amp; green Inter Milan was introduced in the 1970&#39;s. It first appeared in March 1974 against Ayr Utd in a 4-0 win at Celtic Park and only lasted for two seasons. It was also worn against Airdrie in the LCSF of October 1974. But by August 1975 Celtic had reverted to a yellow and green &#39;Norwich&#39; strip.</td>

            This shirt was basically the same shirt design as worn from the late Sixties Lisbon Lions era. Celtic wore it from at least 1972 onto 1978 (as this picture shows in April &#39;78) It was also worn sometimes with green shorts and socks with two white hoops on trim.</td>
