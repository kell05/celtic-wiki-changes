<ul>  <li><a href="/page/Auld%2C+Bertie" target="_self">Back to Bertie Auld homepage</a></li></ul><br><b>(25/10/06) http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/hi/sport/6029303.htm</b><br><br><br>LISBON LION legend Bertie Auld was an integral part of the Celtic team which won nine-in-a-row and lifted the European Cup in 1967 after rejoining Celtic from Birmingham in 1965. The midfielder left for Hibs in 1971 and went on to manage Partick Thistle, the Easter Road club, Dumbarton and Hamilton. <br><br><b>WHAT WAS YOUR BEST MOMENT WITH THE CLUB? </b><br>The Scottish Cup Final in 1965 when we beat Dunfermline 3-2. I was just back from Birmingham and it was quite a time before we had won anything - and that was the start of our run of trophies. And, of course, I scored two that day! <br><br><b>AND YOUR WORST? </b><br>The European Cup Final against Feyenoord because we had done the hard work by beating Leeds in the semi-final. It was similar to us when we beat Inter Milan in &#39;67 - they took advantage of being the underdogs. <br><br><b>WHICH IS YOUR FAVOURITE AWAY GROUND? </b><br>I loved going to Pittodrie in Aberdeen because they had a good football team. Our fans demanded entertainment and you were guaranteed it there.<br><br><b>WHO HAS BEEN THE BEST PLAYER AT YOUR CLUB OVER THE YEARS? </b><br>Jimmy Johnstone - Jinky was a tremendous entertainer and a tremendous person. Bobby Murdoch was also exceptional and I wouldn&#39;t like to separate them. <br><br><b>WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE GOAL OF ALL-TIME? </b><br>The second equaliser in the Dunfermline game. I was all of six inches out and I&#39;ll tell you - that ball hit the back of the net! <br><br><b>WHO WAS YOUR MOST INFLUENTIAL BOSS? </b><br>Gill Merrick gave me a great education. He was a plus for me in so many ways at Birmingham. But the boss - Jock Stein - also had a big influence, as he did with Scottish football as a whole. <br><br><b>WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE PIECE OF CLUB MEMORABILIA? </b><br>My mother was very superstitious and she&#39;d keep an awful lot of things. I&#39;ve got the medals and the jerseys, but the best thing was the shirt I got for being voted in the best XI ever. My son got that framed for me. <br><br><b>WHICH IS YOUR CLUB&#39;S FAVOURITE KIT? </b><br>There are no better than the Hoops - when you pulled them on you seemed to get another six inches around your chest. <br><br><b>WHO IS THE GREATEST SCOTTISH PLAYER OF ALL TIME? </b><br>Scotland was always known in my time for its individuals, we had so many great players from Jim Baxter to Johnstone. But I always thought Dave Mackay was a tremendous player and a great leader. <br><br><b>WHAT ONE THING WOULD YOU CHANGE ABOUT SCOTTISH FOOTBALL? </b><br>I would get back to football being a contact sport again. There&#39;s no need to send people off for two yellow cards, but they should be sent off for diving - that would cut that out. <br><i><br></i>
