On the occasion of his final match at the Stadio Olympico he hired a light aircraft to tow a message of support overhead &#39;from Tarzan&#39;.   <br><br>Annoni turned professional straight from school with non-league side Seregno in 1982. Within a year he joined Serie B club Como who won promotion to Serie A in his first year. He was farmed out to Serie B side Sambenadettese for two seasons and on his return he established himself as a regular before relegation in 1989. He won a lucrative move to Torino in 1990 helping the club through to the UEFA Cup final in 1990/91. He had to settle for a losers medal when Ajax won the cup on the away goals rule. He moved to Roma in 1994 and quickly established himself in the team.<br><br><b>Celtic Career</b><br>Celtic&#39;s interest in the player came to light in early January 1997. However, the pursuit developed into a lengthy saga as Roma were trying to sign France&#39;s Vincent Candela to replace him. Meanwhile as his contract moved into its final months the transfer fee was being driven down but his wage demands were being driven up. When he finally signed for around &pound;300k in late February &#39;97 he was presented as the hard-man to add steel to Tommy Burns&#39; rather accommodating defence. Worryingly, notorious hatchet man Pasquale Bruno - then at Hearts - relayed blood-splattered tales of the pair&#39;s time together at Como and Torino.<br><br>Capable of playing at right-back or centre-half the Italian eventually made his Bhoys debut in the full-back berth in a <a href="/page/1997-03-01%3A+Celtic+2-0+Hearts%2C+Premier+Division" target="_self">2-0 home league win over Heart of Midlothian</a>. Although not always a regular starter, he still played a number of games. With his shaven head and bursting enthusiasm, he soon became a cult figure among some of the Parkhead support, often cut out as an eccentric but loveable figure on the pitch, with a predilection for wearing Celtic gloves, and on occasion a mix of different coloured boots (green and white, obviously). <br><br>Most fondly remembered for a surprisingly disciplined man-marking assignment which shackled Brian Laudrup in the critical New Year&#39;s derby win v Rangers in 1998, and also for his exuberant celebrations after the League Cup Final win two months earlier. <br><br>He was to be an unsung hero in that crucial 1997-98 one-in-a-row season to stop Rangers&#39; ten titles in a row. He played his role well, and this was despite the admittedly limited ability he had. The more critical panned his footballing ability, but he just got on with things. In some ways a back to basics defender is what was needed. A hard, no-nonsense defender and the fans loved this bruising style in a season where the sport&#39;s aestheticism was out the window as both Celtic &amp; Rangers fought tooth and nail for the title.<br><br>The following season he was persistently overlooked by Venglos until a mammoth injury list allowed him back in towards the end. For this reason prospective loans to English clubs had been blocked. In the League&#39;s decisive game a rusty Annoni played alongside the hapless <a href="/page/Marshall%2C+Scott" target="_self">Scott Marshall</a> in a defence torn apart by a Hugh Dallas-inspired Rangers. The writing was on the wall for his time at Celtic.<br><br>After two seasons with the Hoops he returned to Italy in May 1999 to look after his sick father, although he had made noises about his  being dissatisfied at being on the bench too often rather than playing. At his age, he was not going to be a long-term prospect in any case. After missing pre-season he came back only to be informed by Dalglish and Barnes that he was surplus to requirements and the final year of his contract was paid off.<br><b><br>Post-Celtic</b><br>He returned to training with Roma&#39;s <i>primavera</i> (youth) team, but incoming manager Fabio Capello passed on offering the 33-year-old a contract. Further trials with Ravenna came to nothing so Annoni retired and took his coaching badges. He was later reported as working as a scout for Juventus. In more recent years Annoni has indulged in his love of motorbike racing.<br><br>Annoni is the subject of a popular anecdote where in a match where Celtic were performing poorly and Annoni had just been brought on as a substitute, a fan is reported to have exclaimed &quot;<i>Aw naw, no Annoni on an aw noo!</i>&quot; (Oh no, not Annoni on as well now!). All in jest, and the support liked him very much, a bit of a cult hero for some.<br><br><div>A likeable fellow and a player who gave his all for the jersey.
