A highly rated youngster through the Celtic ranks, he was given his debut on the league trophy presentation final day of the 2015-16 season, breaking the record to become the youngest Celtic player on the field for the first team (16 years 71 days old). <br><br>Then incredibly in his first minute with his first touch of the ball, he followed onto a through ball to score his debut goal. An incredible start. It was admittedly already a one-sided easy game as Celtic hammered Motherwell in a league season ending match, 7-0 victory which was the final match for then manager Ronnie Deila. The match was also the start for a record breaking unbeaten run in Scottish football for Celtic.<br><br>As Jack Aitchison was to put it himself: <i><br></i><blockquote><i>&quot;I didn&#39;t know what to do when I scored. It is brilliant. Scoring with my first touch was an amazing feeling. I  was supposed to be in for recovery work and then I got called into the  squad to train yesterday - and then the match squad today. It is amazing. I have been dreaming of this since I was a wee boy. There was a great atmosphere when I scored - I didn&#39;t know what to do! I just need to keep working hard and hopefully I will get more opportunities like this.&quot; </i><br></blockquote><br>He also became the first player &amp; scorer for Celtic born in the 21st century. For many reading that, it made them feel very old. Despite being Scottish born &amp; bred, he admitted he grew up as an  Arsenal fan, which kind of reflected the disappointing changing nature of football  support with some modern youngsters.<br><br>Under the new managerial regime of Brendan Rodgers, he was loaned out to Dumbarton and then Alloa in season 2018/19, but he was struggling to make an impact at those lower tier clubs. Just one goal in this whole time for those two clubs, but he was still young and time was on his side.<br><br>It meant that sadly he missed out on practically the entirety of the incredible domestic Treble-Trebles experience under Brendan Rodgers (nine domestic trophies in a row). Brendan Rodgers was actually very keen on promoting youth talent (and did a fine job of it), but Aitchison seemed to be passed over, making just two appearances during Brendan Rodgers&#39; reign. Competition was very tight at Celtic for forward and midfield roles, although many other young players managed to break through, the most in generations, including Mikey Johnstone who was of a similar age playing for similar roles. <br><br>[...]<br><br>[Played for Forrest Green Rovers, the world&#39;s first green friendly vegan/vegetarian club....]<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3"

heart</h3><div>BBC</div><div>https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36318460</div><div>2016</div>The record books were rewritten at Celtic Park as Jack Aitchison became the club&#39;s youngest debutant at 16 years, 71 days. And, with his first touch of the ball, the academy striker provided a fairytale finale to Sunday&#39;s seven-goal routing of Motherwell by completing Celtic&#39;s scoring.Media attention and social media celebration of the achievement has come unexpectedly.But, while it&#39;s his youth in focus, Aitchison displays maturity beyond his years off the field.Aitchison is level-headed and grateful for the opportunity afforded him by outgoing manager Ronny Deila.The Scotland Under-17 international received his call up into the senior Celtic squad at short notice.  &quot;It  was amazing,&quot; Aitchison told BBC Scotland. &quot;It was mind-blowing that  Ronny asked me to come into the squad, to stay overnight with them in  the hotel. &quot;And then when he called me on to give me my debut in front of 50,000 fans, it was just a dream come true.&quot;Even the moments leading up to Aitchison&#39;s call off the bench seemed surprising.&quot;I  was just back from the toilet,&quot; the teenager revealed as he recalled  his entrance into a game after which Celtic received the Scottish  Premiership trophy.&quot;He said Jack go and warm up and the fans were clapping as I was warming up. It was just amazing.&quot;Just looking around the stadium and seeing how busy it was. I&#39;ve never played in front of a crowd like that.&quot;Then,  just moments after he stepped on to the field of play, Aitchison found  himself with a scoring opportunity in front of goal.&quot;It was my first touch, I was lucky the deflection ran into my path,&quot; he said. &quot;I ran onto it and just hit it.&quot;As soon as I hit it, I knew it was going in. It was the best feeling in my life so far.&quot;It  meant he had not only taken over from Mark Fotheringham as Celtic&#39;s  youngest-ever player but took the record from David McLean, who was the  previous youngest scorer at 16 years and 317 days back in 1907.Now Aitchison says he will work hard to improve and his maturity is such that he is very aware he is not the finished article.He  frequently states &quot;the hard work starts now&quot;, he&#39;s simply looking for  &quot;more opportunities&quot; and promises he will &quot;keep my feet on the ground&quot;.<br>With the search for the new Celtic manager ongoing, Aitchison says diplomatically that he doesn&#39;t mind who the club appoint.He is savvy enough to state: &quot;It&#39;s up to me to get in his good books.&quot;The teenager, who has just signed a new three-year contract, admits that Celtic is not the team of his childhood dreams.&quot;I&#39;m an Arsenal supporter,&quot; he revealed.&quot;My dad has always been Arsenal and I just love the way they play.<br>&quot;However, he&#39;s not admitting to dreams of playing for the Gunners yet and sees his future very much at Celtic Park.Jack Aitchison is a young man with a smart head and feet to match.Certainly, he&#39;s one to watch for the future.<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
