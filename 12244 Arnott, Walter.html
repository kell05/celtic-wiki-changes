He played in ten consecutive Scotland v England matches (a Scottish record in that old series of matches). <br><br>His solitary appearance for the Bhoys came on February 23rd <a href="/page/1895" target="_self">1895</a> in a 4-4 draw at home to Third Lanark in a league clash. The then veteran Arnott had been drafted in as a &#39;guest&#39; to help plug the gaps in a leaky Celtic defence. As the scoreline shows it was a mission even he could not manage but it was great to have the honour that Celtic can count him as having played for our club.<br><br>He guested for a number of clubs including the Corinthians,   Linfield (where he won an Irish Cup medal), Newcastle West End, Notts   County and St Bernard&rsquo;s. <br><br>A keen sportsman, Arnott was also a noted bowls, cricket, and tennis player, and an avid yachtsman.<br><br>He passed away in May 1931. <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career</h3><div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  1895</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  1</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  1</td></tr><tr><td width="16%">Goals:</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Honours with Celtic</h3>none <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Pictures</h3>  <ul><li>  <a href="/page/Arnott%2C+Walter+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul><div><h3>Links</h3><ul><li>Glasgow Herald Obituary: http://goo.gl/sdXVl</li></ul></div>   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Articles</h3><h3>Scottish Sport History</h3>link: http://www.scottishsporthistory.com/1/post/2013/05/celebrating-walter-arnott-born-150-years-ago-today.html<br><h3> </h3><div class="paragraph">Today is the 150th anniversary of the birth of Walter Arnott,  one of football&#39;s true &#39;greats&#39; in the Victorian era. Born in  Pollokshields on 12 May 1863, he was inspired as a young boy by watching  the first international at Hamilton Crescent in 1872, and joined  Queen&#39;s Park ten years later. Over the following decade he was capped 14  times by Scotland, including a record ten consecutive appearances  against England. <br><br>He won the Scottish Cup with Queen&#39;s Park three times  appeared for them in two FA Cup finals, and even found time to guest for  a range of other clubs in Scotland, England and Ireland - winning an  Irish Cup medal with Linfield and turning out for Celtic, Newcastle West  End, St Bernard&#39;s and Notts County. He died in Glasgow on 18 May 1931.<br><br>He regularly wrote articles for newspapers and was interviewed about  the early days, but never compiled a full biography. However, in 1928 he  did publish privately a little booklet for distribution at a reunion of  Vale of Leven players, and I have now digitised this for posterity. <a class="external" href="http://www.scottishsporthistory.com/uploads/3/3/6/0/3360867/arnott_booklet.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Click here</a> to read it or visit my <a class="external" href="http://www.scottishsporthistory.com/published-articles-and-books.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Publications </a>   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><img align="bottom" alt="Arnott, Walter - Pic" height="668" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/AXbqsI6M_XNDyEXNW3ORPA264101/GW860H668" title="Arnott, Walter - Pic" width="860"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Arnott, Walter - Pic" height="186" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/iB7EYoV0K03hvr9yzeXF7w101879/GW469H186" title="Arnott, Walter - Pic" width="469"><br>
