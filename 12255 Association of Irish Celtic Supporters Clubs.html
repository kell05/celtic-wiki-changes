Naturally the idea proved to be a huge success with club&#39;s finally having the opportunity to pool resources and follow the Bhoys with much greater frequency then previously possible.</font><br><br><font color="#000000">Delegate meetings are held on a province-by-province rota basis. the association also has its very own succesful magazine - The View from the 32 - which promotes both Celtic and the A.I.C.S.C. An </font>Annual Charity Dinner is the highlight of the A.I.C.S.C social calendar and the event has in the past welcomed a whole host of past Celtic greats.
