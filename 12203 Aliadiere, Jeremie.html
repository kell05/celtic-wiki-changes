Much was expected of Aliadiere (by the fans in particular), with many believing the club had got a bit of a steal. Seen as a good prospect for Arsenal (having even played for the then highly regarded France U-21s and scoring a goal), Celtic were expected to take advantage of his availability. He&#39;d even won a Best Young Talent award in season 2003-04 for the League Cup in England. <br><br>It didn&#39;t quite pan out well. He was a bit of a sheep in wolves&#39; clothing, and his performances at Celtic (senior &amp; reserve side) were never up to much of a standard (to the surprise of many). No stand out performances or anything of note. His only competitive first team matches were in Europe where the Celtic First Team were knocked out by the lowly Artmedia Bratislava. It was a disastrous start to his time at Celtic and not easy to pick up from this knock.<br><br>In fairness to Aliadiere, the repercussions from that set of defeats had such an impact on the club that Gordon Strachan&#39;s philosophy on how to approach tactics for games were rapidly &amp; heavily revised. Effectively a more cautious and less offensive play mentality was not a gameplan for fitting in Aliadiere, and the writing was on the wall. Saying that, others with less grandiose CVs fitted in well enough. <br><br>His failure to settle and cement (or even find) a place in the first team, combined with the form of Shaun Maloney, saw him slip out of the first team picture and he returned south after only a month or so.  <br><br>To be honest, most people were more saddened that his girlfriend (the very lovely &#39;<i>glamour model</i>&#39; Leilani) would be leaving Glasgow with him. That&#39;s the breaks for you.<br><br>He complained that Gordon Strachan didn&#39;t give him enough of a chance. Just two substitution appearances and no full match appearances in his short spell possibly is an argument for his case, but it&#39;s all history now. Maybe the support were too in awe of his CV as he come through the respected Arsenal academy, but the coaches saw upfront his true level &amp; ability. Disappointing it never worked out for him nevertheless.<br><br>After returning to Arsenal he was loaned to West Ham till January 2006 and then Wolverhampton Wanderers to the end of 2005-06. <br><br>In July 2006 he was sold by Arsenal to Middlesborough for &pound;2million and given a contract to June 2010, but it never worked out and his career was steadily heading downwards. His career picked up later in a move to Lorient in France where he achieved some degree of success for himself.<br><br>He never reached the heights many believed at first he would make, and in that sense it appears that Celtic made the right judgement to cut his time short.<br><br>Despite the move not having worked out, in his own reflection on the time he appreciated the chance he was given at Celtic:<br><blockquote><i>&quot;To be honest I have really good memories because the fans were fantastic. The city and the stadium were amazing.&quot; </i><br></blockquote><br>We wish him the best.<br>    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows

he lasted just TWO months at Parkhead  </h3></div><div>  Clipped from : <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/3420228/celtic-jeremie-aliadiere-arsenal/"

sub appearances for Gordon Strachan  JEREMIE ALIADIERE has lifted the lid on why he lasted just TWO months at Celtic.  The French striker joined from Arsenal on a season-long loan in 2005 but managed just two sub appearances.<br>Jeremie Aliadiere lasted just two months at Celtic   His spell at Parkhead was quickly cut short by Gordon Strachan following the arrival of Polish international Maciej Zurawski.  But despite failing to make the grade, Aliadiere has nothing but fond memories from his short time at the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/" target="_self">Bhoys</a>.  He told <a href="https://talksport.com/" target="_self">talkSPORT</a>: &ldquo;The previous season I got injured badly on my knee so it was a mutual decision with Arsene Wenger that it would be good for me to go on loan.  &ldquo;Celtic came up and for me I thought &lsquo;Wow, what an opportunity to go to such a big club&rsquo;.  Aliadiere was told by Gordon Strachan that he could cut short his time at Celtic   &ldquo;So I signed for a year and started pre-season, everything was going well. I was working hard and trying to do as best as I could for the club.  &ldquo;Suddenly the club bought another striker, Zurawski, Polish striker, and from that day when he arrived I became a sub.  &ldquo;I was on the bench, but I thought &lsquo;I&rsquo;m here for a year and I&rsquo;m going to fight and try to do my best and get in the starting XI&rsquo;.  &ldquo;And then just before the transfer window ended, the manager Gordon Strachan just came in and said to me, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve bought this player and because he&rsquo;s part of the club and you&rsquo;re only on loan he will get more of an opportunity than you&rsquo;.  <br>Helost his place to Polish hitman Maciej Zurawski   &ldquo;He said &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re not happy with that then you can move&rsquo;. The point was for me to get chances to play because I was on the bench at Arsenal so going to Celtic to be on the bench as well didn&rsquo;t really make sense to me.&rdquo;  Aliadiere then found himself in a race against time to find a new club ahead of the looming transfer deadline.  He said:&ldquo;Because I had a week left, I straight away called my agent and said this is the situation and we managed to move to West Ham on loan again for another season.  &ldquo;We had Alan Pardew at West Ham at the time and I thought, &lsquo;Wow that&rsquo;s a great escape&rsquo; because I&rsquo;m not going to play for Celtic and I was obviously gutted to leave the club because I was all settled there, everything was going great apart from not playing.  &ldquo;So I managed to move in the last couple of days before the transfer window ended to West Ham.&rdquo;  Highly-rated by Gunners legend Arsene Wenger as a youngster,Aliadiere failed to live up to his early potential.  As well as Arsenal, the 35-year-old played for West Ham, Wolves, Middlesbrough, Lorient, Umm Salai and Muaither.  But when asked if his dreamwas unfulfilled at Celtic, he admitted:&ldquo;For sure because it&rsquo;s a massive club. I loved my time there.  &ldquo;When I was there I really hoped that it was going to work out for me and I could show what I was capable of doing and I felt that got taken away from me at the time.&rdquo; <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3></div><br>
