The conduct of the spectators, it stated was about the worst their team had ever experienced. The execrable oaths and blasphemies yelled by the crowd were simply indescribable. At the close of the game the spectators rushed on the field, and the Celtic players were assailed with all sorts of vile epithets by the crowd, and were otherwise severely assaulted. (Laughter) The Abercorn secretary asked that the matter should be delayed until he could get information, and this was agreed to, the matter being held over until the next meeting of the Committee on 4th April.<br><br>The Glasgow Herald - Feb 22, 1893, Page 6.<br><br>S.F.A.
