Non-food shops are closed on Monday mornings as well: food shops are open on Monday mornings but closed on Mon afternoon. For Sunday shopping, there are the multimedia stores in Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, Piazza Duomo, Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Via Torino, a few fashion stores on Corso Vittorio Emanuele, and, near Garibaldi station, Corso Como 10.<br><br>The range of retail outlets in Milan runs from the high fashion boutiques, to small shops, department stores, supermarkets, discount outlets, and street markets. Some parts of the city have a specific character as regards shopping. Via Montenapoleone and the adjoining streets (within the area bordered by Via della Spiga, Corso Venezia, Via Bigli and Via Manzoni) are the high fashion area. There are furniture and lighting shops in Corso Matteotti, Corso Monforte and Via Durini.<br><br>Piazza San Babila, Corso Vittorio Emanuele, Piazza Duomo (including Galleria Vittorio Emanuele) and Via Dante form a continuous pedestrian precinct with many shops, mainly clothes, but also books and media.<br><br>Other important, less central shopping streets include Corso Buenos Aires (near the station), Corso XXII Marzo, and Corso Vercelli. Via Torino is strong on fashion for young people.<br><br>The Brera district, around the like-named academy and gallery, was once the reign of artists: there are still a number of private galleries in Via Brera, Via del Carmine and Via Solferino, but these streets are now great for shopping. Via Fiori Chiari, Via Madonnina and Piazza del Carmine form another attractive pedestrian precinct with small, interesting shops, and in the evening the area is kept lively by virtue of the many bars and caf&eacute;s.<br><br>Corso di Porta Ticinese, particularly in the stretch between the churches of San Lorenzo and Sant&#39;Eustorgio, has many trendy, ethnic-type shops for clothes, furniture etc., and it has also become a focal point for young nightlife. It is close to another characteristic shopping and nightlife area, the Navigli canal district (Ripa di Porta Ticinese, Via Ascanio Sforza). On the Naviglio Grande canal, on the last Sunday of each month, there is a large antiques market with stalls selling everything from postcards to furniture.<br><br>Via Paolo Sarpi is the home to Milan&#39;s Chinatown (actually just a few streets), and so here there are many shops selling their specialities, in particular leatherware.<br><br><br><img alt="user posted image" src=""><br><br><img alt="user posted image" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/DK9Ttvd_DjUnDpwbisGmGA40626" title="user posted image"><br><br>Happy Holiday&#39;s<br><br>BBB<br><br>Addition to BBB&#39;s pub guide :<br><br>I&#39;m a long term resident in Milan. I&#39;m not a Celtic fan but as an interista I&#39;ll be supporting you on Wednesday. I&#39;ve noticed a lack of good information on the board about where to go in Milan. I&#39;ve written a quick pub guide which should contain enough info to keep most people going. A pint should generally cost between 4 and 5 Euro though it can be cheaper if you drink in small, coffee bar type places. You won&#39;t find brands like Nastro Azzurro or Moretti in most bars as the Italians prefer Guinness, Harp, McEwans and Tennents. Look out for Tennents Super on Draught and try the local cocktails if you want value for money. A Long Island Iced Tea in most of these bars will cost about 5 or 6 Euro and contain six measures at least.<br><br>Irish Pubs:<br>Matricola, Viale Romagna 43 (corner of Via Pascoli). First &quot;Official&quot; Irish pub in Italy. Not all that Irish these days but does decent food and a reasonable pint of Guinness. Nearest metro stop is Piola (Green line).<br><br>Pogue Mahone, Via Salmini 1. Small pub with an Irish feel (very smoky though!) Plenty of Celtic/Irish &quot;stuff&quot; on the walls. Extremely busy on normal nights and likely to be packed with Celtic fans. Little or no food. Nearest metro stop Porta Romana (yellow line)<br><br>Murphy&#39;s Law, Via Savona. Not a bad looking bar. Has gone downhill in recent years IMHO. Sells Murphys rather than Guinness. Nearest Metro Porta Genova (Green line)<br><br>O&#39;Connells - Via Brera. Small pub. Not a bad pint but likely to be inside any alcohol ban area. Loud techno music late at night so not ideal perhaps. Nearest metro Montenapoleone (Yellow) or Duomo (Red). Good free buffet from 6pm til 8.<br><br>Blackfriars via ? (near foot of Via Torino). A reasonable pub but not really handy for the stadium. Excellent free buffet. Nearest metro stop is Duomo (25 mins by foot). An interesting selection of religious items in the backroom.<br><br>Binks - Ripa di Porta Ticinese 71. Another Murphy&#39;s pub, not far from the Porta Genova metro stop. It&#39;s run by a former Irish jockey who used to manage Murphy&#39;s Law. <br><br>Loolapaloosa - Corso Como 15. A quiet Irish bar during the day but a crazy disco pub later on. Look out for girls dancing on tables. Not easy to get in later on. Open til 5am Thursday to Saturday. Open til 3 other nights.<br><br>Other pubs:<br><br>Kirribilly - Via Castelmorrone 7 (www.kirribilly.com). Nominally an Australian pub but full of football paraphernalia. Very friendly management. A wee bit out of the way. Roughly 15 mins on foot from Porta Venezia metro stop (Red line).<br><br>Bar Magenta - Via Carducci, corner of Corso Magenta. On the main tram line (no 16) out to the stadium. Almost certain to be affected by any alcohol ban. If there is no ban (there wasn&#39;t for Inter-Arsenal) then it will be absolutely mobbed and a better bet would be a wee bar round the corner from it called Ai Tre Morsi (Via Terraggio). Magenta is really nice inside but the service leaves a lot to be desired. It&#39;s one of those where you have to pay at the till then go to the bar with your receipt. Likely to be open after the match and I&#39;ll probably stop off there. (nearest metro Cadorna - green/red line). Very good panini<br><br>Akkademia - Via Ravizza - on the tram route to the stadium. Not a bad place if you&#39;re in the area. Decent free buffet from 7pm onwards. Nearest metro stop is De Angeli or Wagner (red line).<br><br>Caffe Victoria - Via Clerici - a good city centre bar selling reasonable pints and good cocktails. Open til about 3am. Definitely affected by any alcohol ban. Nearest metro stops - Duomo and Cordusio (red line)<br><br><br>There are many more places on the Navigli which can be accessed by heading for the Porta Genova stop then wandering.<br><br>Bear in mind that to get to the stadium, you can either get the no 16 tram from the centre of town (near the Duomo) or get the metro to Lotto (red line, Molino Dorino branch) and then the shuttle bus to the stadium. This should be considered when choosing your pre match drinking venue. Post match almost all of the places mentioned will be open until at least 2am<br><br>As for the question about drinking on the street, as far as I know it&#39;s allowed but it&#39;s pretty unusual for Italians.<br><br>Alcohol can be cheaply bought in all supermarkets though when Man Utd came here a few years back even the supermarkets had cordoned off the drinks alleys.<br><br>The main square is Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square) which is at the Duomo metro stop on Red and Yellow lines.<br><br>One tip for anyone thinking of drinking inside the stadium is that the police/stewards will confiscate the tops from any plastic bottles of coke/water or whatever. They will not check what&#39;s in there though. It&#39;s perfectly possible to take in a litre and a half of vodka and coke or whatever else takes your fancy.........<br>
