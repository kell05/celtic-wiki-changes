Not of Glasgow, not really of his native Maryhill - just the bit  we can see from the front step of his old tenement home at 95 Panmure  Street, which turns out to be a whole world.</div>                       &quot;When  folk ask me what my education was I tell them: &#39;This, here. This place  and its people, all of them right characters.&#39; I was born through that  windae there, son, five of us to the one room. And when my old man died,  God rest his soul, we couldn&#39;t help noticing that his occupation on our birth certificates was different each time. Yes, the university of adversity... &quot;<br><br>The  Lisbon Lion points to an old works entrance - his father had a stint  there - which served as a goalmouth for street kickabouts, then across  to Partick Thistle&#39;s Firhill: &quot;Ten minutes from the end we&#39;d pick up our  tennis ball and rush down for the opening of the gates.&quot; He reels of  his neighbours, the Butterleys and the Mucklewees: &quot;Always, if our folks  were out, we&#39;d get jam pieces passed through to us.&quot; And being Bertie,  he doesn&#39;t just point with his finger but also that famously jutting  cartoon chin, one the great Dudley D Watkins himself couldn&#39;t have  improved upon.<br><br>Auld was at No 95 when I suggested meeting up for a  natter, not about Lisbon this time but the Old Firm, who reconvene  tomorrow. A charity has spruced up the block for the young homeless and  its most famous former occupant was invited to the re-opening. He&#39;s back  again today because one trip down memory lane isn&#39;t enough, not when  you&#39;re Bertie and you love reminiscing and Celtic fans in far-off  Toronto will pay your fare to listen to your tales, as happened  recently.<br><br>&quot;Over there used to be the pawnbroker&#39;s. I took along a  suit once, and a bed-shirt a neighbour had given me. I was glad the  place had these cubicles for a wee bit of privacy - like at confession,  ha-ha - because I was a player by then. I still got recognised, and when  the old boy behind the counter saw the shirt was soiled, I was dead  embarrassed. &#39;Ten shillings for the jaikit and the breeks,&#39; he said,  &#39;and two bob for the shirt and the *****.&#39;<br><br>&quot;And see that maroon-coloured shop?&quot; Hand and chin are pointing to the bottom of Panmure Street.<br><br>&quot;When  Celtic sold me to Birmingham City and I wasn&#39;t going to be around to  provide as much, I bought it for my maw for 550 quid.&quot; He&#39;d return to  Parkhead, of course: older, wiser, less harem-scarem but still  fundamentally a rapscallion, a midfielder brought in from the wing to  form a silk-and-steel double-act with Bobby Murdoch - and to do his bit  for immortality.<br><br>Now we&#39;re at a garage, run by his son Robert. Auld wants the interview  to happen here as a &quot;wee boost&quot; for the business. But it&#39;s no  panel-beating workshop, rather a Mercedes show room and Robert is the  principal dealer. Bertie - nicknamed &quot;Ten-thirty&quot; by Jimmy Johnstone -  checks the price of a gull-winged job. &quot;&pound;149,993 - I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve  got that on me. Tell you what: the cheque you we were going to give me  for this interview - just write it out to my laddie.&quot; We&#39;re not paying  for the interview, but I&#39;ve stumped up for alleged comedians who&#39;ve  entertained me less. What a card.<br><br>And what a snappily-dressed  card. Auld is as dapper as you&#39;d expect a celebrity Glaswegian of his  vintage to be. He&#39;s 73, with that fine head of hair still intact, and  I&#39;m particularly impressed by his patent black pointed loafers - what in  Parliamo Glasgow you&#39;d call a &quot;rerr perr&quot; - which twinkle on the tiled  showroom floor as he re-tells the story about the pawnbroker, adding  that the transaction was to raise the funds for a tank of petrol for his  very first motor, a Vauxhall Velux. The salesmen love his patter, that  big daft grin, and another yarn about hard times in Maryhill, such as  the thrilling day when new neighbours arrived with a ball&#39;s rubber  inner. &quot;At last we could blow up our leather outsider and play a proper  game.&quot;<br><br>So anyway, finally, about bloody time: the Old Firm. Does  he remember his debut in the fixture? &quot;Oh aye, I&#39;d been out on loan at  Dumbarton when Mr (Jimmy] McGrory called me back: &#39;You&#39;re playing at  Ibrox on Saturday.&#39; Me, just 18, recently of Boghead, up against big  Corky (George] Young, Scotland captain and icon - what a fantastic  baptism. It was the Glasgow Cup but when you belong to this city there  are no meaningless Old Firm games. Celtic and Rangers could be playing  for a china cup, or it could be just toe-to-toe spitting - the people  would come. I seem to remember Bobby Shearer kicking me up in the air  and Harold Davis volleying me on the way back down and us losing 1-0. <br><br>In  his second, glistening spell at Celtic his opponents in the light blue  were John Greig, Dave Smith and Kai Johansen - scorer of a stupendous  1966 Scottish Cup-winning goal against Celtic that Auld can still  scarcely comprehend - and they were no less uncompromising. &quot;I remember  Greigy in the tunnel at Ibrox wanting to know what our win bonus was.  &#39;Three quid.&#39; He laughed because they were on six quid.<br><br>&#39;Aye,&#39; I said, &#39;but our three&#39;s guaranteed.&#39; The bonuses weren&#39;t much,  so for 90 minutes my attitude was: &#39;That lot are trying to take money  from my kids and my maw.&#39; I&#39;m sure the Rangers guys thought the same.&quot;  The bonus for lifting the European Cup in 1967, by the way, was &pound;1500 per man - &quot;but it was taxed so really 900&quot;.<br><br>Auld  still loves Celtic v Rangers but despaired at the mayhem the fixture  generated last season and wonders how the multi-cultural millionaires  who engage in it now can possibly enjoy the level of banter generated by  Bertie and his home-grown contemporaries. &quot;The humour&#39;s missing from  the Old Firm now, I think. When you enjoy something you must express it.  One of the ways you can do that is with a grin, and with a chin like  mine&#39;s you can&#39;t go wrong! One time, Bobby Shearer had booted me again  and I said: &#39;Do you know there&#39;s a ball on the park.&#39; He said: &#39;You mean  we get one of them as well?&#39; Willie Henderson was awfie quick-witted.  And &#39;Tiny&#39; Wharton the ref always had a quip. &#39;You dirty big bandit,&#39; I  told him after we&#39;d lost to Rangers, &#39;you never gave us nothing today.&#39;  &#39;You&#39;re wrong, Mr Auld. I awarded you a shy in your own half in the last  minute.&#39;<br><br>Bertie is like a cabaret turn, especially in those  shoes. His most famous story, of course, concerns Lisbon, in the tunnel,  eyeing up swarthy Inter Milan with their luxurious strips and luminous  teeth and shattering their serenity with a blast of &quot;Hail, hail, the  Celts are here&quot;. Does he ever get fed up telling it? &quot;No, coming from  where I did, I was incredibly lucky to have the life of a footballer. No  player should forget this is such a privilege, and what the game means  to the ordinary guy.&quot;<br><br>There are a couple of times today, though,  when he&#39;s almost lost for words. In the first Old Firm game after  Lisbon, back at Ibrox, Davie Provan broke his leg in a clash with Auld.  It was a bad one. The snapping of bone, so they say, could be heard on  the terraces. &quot;Ach, I don&#39;t like talking about that,&quot; he says. &quot;A 50-50  ball, just one of those things, but not great, no.&quot; Weren&#39;t Rangers  angry enough with him to threaten to sue? &quot;Yes, but I had the famous  Glasgow lawyer Joe Beltrami representing me. The verdict: not Provan.&quot;<br><br>In  Jock Stein&#39;s legendary team, Auld and Murdoch didn&#39;t split the silk and  steel duties; these were one-stop-shop midfielders. YouTube footage  reminds us of how Bertie could pick out a pass in the Old Firm pell  mell. But he was never self-conscious about playing with &quot;a bit of fire  ... you needed it; everyone did back then&quot;. It was certainly needed in  the 1967 World Club Championship against Argentina&#39;s Racing. &quot;What a  bunch of cowards, spitting and stuff behind your back rather than  man-to-man. So eventually I decked one of them.&quot; He was sent off but  refused to leave the pitch.<br><br>Yes, Bertie could, as they say, look after himself.<br><br>Is it true he featured in Jackie Charlton&#39;s little black book of  unfinished business? &quot;So they tell me!&quot; In the 1970 European Cup  semi-final against Charlton&#39;s Leeds at Hampden (attendance: 135,000 &quot;and  then some&quot;) Mick Jones warned him at half-time: &quot;The Hunter&#39;s coming to  get you.&quot; Bertie: &quot;He meant Norman, of course, but I just acted daft.  &#39;Who, White Hunter off the telly?&#39;&quot; (The Africa-set jungle adventures  dated from 1957, the year of Auld&#39;s Old Firm debut).  And then there was  Nobby Stiles.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t like talking about that either,&quot; he says,  &quot;but here&#39;s what happened: it was my first game for Hibs and Nobby had  been given a free to Middlesboro. It was a friendly but in my book  there&#39;s no such thing: the punters have paid to get in and the ball&#39;s  there to be won. Nobby clattered me, broke my collar bone. Our trainer  Tom McNiven said: &#39;You&#39;ll have to come off.&#39; &#39;Give me five minutes,&#39; I  said, and I gave Nobby a wee short ball and, well, he had to be carted  off on a stretcher. But he&#39;d have done the same to me.&quot; You might  imagine that Auld will always and forever be a Stein disciple and you&#39;d  be right, but while Big Jock is rated the best manager he reckons Eddie  Turnbull was the best coach.<br><br>In many cases, he stresses, foes  became friends. &quot;When I was manager of Partick Thistle Davie Provan ran  the youth team. We&#39;ve had such rare laughs, the pair of us, and he still  phones me once a month.&quot; In his Birmingham days Auld was sent off for  slugging two Fulham players, one of them England captain Johnny Haynes,  and when the latter came to live in Edinburgh he became a buddy as well.  And when he and George Young became hoteliers near each other they used  to meet up every Tuesday afternoon for a natter. &quot;Corky was lovely, no  evil or badness about him, a gentleman, as were so many of the Rangers  guys I played against&quot;.<br><br>Perhaps we should close the chapter on  Bertie&#39;s dark side - he&#39;s a devoted family man, a grandfather, who met  his wife Liz at the dancing at Glasgow&#39;s Locarno and married her at the  church next to Birmingham&#39;s St Andrews - and give some more space to his  hair, his flair and his hats. You never missed Auld in the 1960s with  his jet-black barnet and he scored five against Airdie in Stein&#39;s first  game as Celtic manager and a double in the 1965 Scottish Cup win over  Dunfermline, which began the trophy haul under Big Jock, also starting  Auld&#39;s penchant for fat cigars.<br><br>He donned a trilby to celebrate  Lisbon and a fedora for the victory over Leeds and while Hibs fans may  not remember his time as Easter Road boss as a golden period, they  haven&#39;t forgotten the gigantic bunnets. &quot;My favourite was made of  cashmere, a present from Celtic fans in the US. And I needed it when we  played Manchester United in a friendly when our undersoil heating  ensured we were the only show in town. Big Ron Atkinson had a  herringbone coat draped to the floor with a fur collar.<br><br>I think I matched him with my camelhair, velvet collar - and when Willie  Jamieson scored our equaliser I flung the bunnet in the air and it  hovered there like Sputnik.&quot;<br><br>Entertainment. Hibs chairman Tom  Hart - &quot;Another lovely man&quot; - wanted it that day, going to the bother of  hiring Man U a private plane. Jock Stein demanded it of his players  every game - &quot;The last thing he said as we filed out of the  changing-room was: &#39;Go and entertain these people.&#39;&quot; And Auld swears by  it. &quot;I loved to entertain, just loved it. When Jock said that your chest  would swell up all the way down the tunnel and by the time you got on  the pitch you thought you were going to burst out of your shirt. Mind  you, sometimes I took him too literally.<br><br>&quot;Once against Clyde I  decided I&#39;d sit on the ball. After the game Jock lifted me off my feet  by grabbing me round the throat.&quot; That sounds a bit extreme, I say, and  Bertie &quot;Ten-thirty&quot; Auld, emeritus professor of the university of  adversity (Maryhill campus), flashes another of those trademark  widescreen grins. &quot;Aye well, I actually sat on it three times.&quot;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>    </h3><h3>BERTIE AULD, CELTIC LEGEND AND LISBON LION</h3><br>By David Potter (from KeepTheFaith website)<br><br>David W Potter, Keep The Faith&#39;s resident historian and author, waxes lyrical about the Celtic Legend and Lisbon Lion, Bertie Auld.<br><br>David writes:<br><br>BERTIE AULD<br><br>There is something quintessentially Celtic about Bertie Auld. The gallus Glaswegian boy with a tendency to self-destruct now and again, but with an almost superhuman ability on occasion, Bertie was the Bhoy that the fans would identify with, the one who seemed to sum up everything about Celtic. How good it is that he is mentioned in the Willie Maley Song, &ldquo;Murdoch, Tully, Johnstone, Auld and Hay&rdquo;!<br><br>He is certainly a Celt through and through.<br><br>He could of course have played for Rangers for his religious credentials would have suited, but once he joined Parkhead in 1955, there was no doubt that Celtic was his team. He was a talented left winger. In fact he might have played in the 7-1 game of 1957, for he played in the Quarter Finals and the Semi Final, but the nod was given to Neil Mochan instead. Bertie may have been disappointed, but his great moments were yet to come.<br><br>It did not look like that in the next few years, however. Auld played in that dysfunctional forward line which was changed whimsically by Chairman Bob Kelly from week to week. Yet he never really let Celtic down and even had three outings for Scotland, in one of which he was sent off.<br><br>For reasons of his poor disciplinary record and his general insubordination to the autocratic regime, Bertie incurred repeatedly the displeasure of Bob Kelly, and thus when Celtic reached the Final of the Scottish Cup in 1961, there was no Bertie Auld. Jock Stein, then Manager of Dunfermline, was delighted with that and it was Celtic&#39;s loss. A matter of days after that disastrous night, Bertie was on his way to Birmingham City for &pound;15,000.<br><br>Thus ended a painful time for Bertie, but for Celtic and their fans the agony intensified for the next four years. Meanwhile Bertie played in a Fairs Cities Cup final for Birmingham and won a medal in the League Cup, ironically enough in 1963, the year of Celtic&#39;s greatest catastrophe, the 0-3 defeat in the Scottish Cup Final Replay. Birmingham fans loved him and tolerated his eccentricities. But like Tommy McInally of old, Bertie was pining for home.<br><br>Bertie returned to Paradise in mid-January 1965 when Celtic were undergoing another crisis. But what Bertie knew (and the rest of the world didn&#39;t) was that Jock Stein was on his way back. Indeed it was Jock who had been instrumental in bringing him back, possibly even making it a part of the deal with Bob Kelly. Jock then made the crucial decision to play Auld inside and to allow Bobby Lennox to play on the left wing. As you know, when Jock Stein became Celtic manager, it was he and not the Chairman that decided team matters.<br><br>The effect of Stein&#39;s positional changes would be electrifying, although not necessarily instantaneous, for some dreadful games were played in spring 1965. But Auld organized the rescue for Celtic in the Scottish Cup Semi Final against Motherwell when the team were 1-0 and then 2-1 down, then in that glorious Final against Dunfermline, he scored both equalizing goals. The first one remains vividly in the memory when a shot from Charlie Gallagher hit the bar and rebounded up in the air and Bertie was there waiting for it. The second was a brilliant one-two with Bobby Lennox, whose telepathic understanding of him was wondrous to behold! And then after McNeill&#39;s Cup Final winner, as we all awaited Deliverance (and expected it to be cruelly snatched away from us), it was Bertie who, before he took a corner kick, insisted in removing police coats to waste time, and it was Bertie who raised both arms to the exultant Celtic End at full time.<br><br>An old timer would enthuse about Bertie Auld over the next five years occasionally in a Freudian slip calling him Tommy McInally. The parallels were so striking. The ball control, the visionary passes, the cannonball shot were all in evidence as indeed were the equally desirable characteristics of aggression and determination, now usually well reined in by Jock Stein.<br><br>Lisbon was of course the greatest day of all, but it might not have happened but for Bertie Auld. He started the singing of &ldquo;Sure, it&#39;s a grand old team&rdquo; in the tunnel to terrify the slick, urbane Italians, and by full time, all Italy knew that it was indeed a grand old team.<br><br>Great games were commonplace for Bertie. One could single out the League Cup Final of 1968-9 against Hibs, the one the following year when he scored the only goal against St.Johnstone and the Scottish Cup Final 4-0 defeat of Rangers. But my own favourite was a virtuoso performance against Dundee at Dens Park in January 1971, when he was almost on the way out of Celtic Park. But what a glorious sunset as he inspired Celtic to beat a strong Dundee side, 8-1!<br><br>He had been involved in the sad events of Milan in 1970 and must take his share of the blame in the same way that he deserves his share of the credit for beating Leeds United in the European Cup Semi Final. But it was America in summer 1970 that was the catalyst for Bertie&#39;s departure from Celtic Park. He and Tommy Gemmell were sent home by acting Manager Sean Fallon for indiscipline &ndash; whether it was for making advances to waitresses, urinating on a bus or getting drunk (believe what you want!), it was another McInally-type facet of his character, as if he couldn&#39;t be good all the time!<br><br>But this was a Celtic undergoing reconstruction after the Milan fiasco against Feyenoord, and it was clear in Stein&#39;s rebuilding that there was no long-term room for Bertie Auld, and in 1971 he joined Hibs on a free transfer. He came on as a substitute for Hibs in the Dixie Deans Cup Final of 1972 to a tremendous cheer from the Celtic fans, who still loved him.<br><br>He later managed Partick Thistle (twice), Hibs and Dumbarton, but it is with Celtic that he will be forever associated.<br><br>He was as good as anyone else in the Lisbon Lions team &ndash; and that is some compliment! For the position of left sided midfield in the Greatest Celtic XI of all time, there would be few better. He was quite simply a superb player and a superb Celt.<br><br>Bertie is now a flamboyant dresser, usually in green, and a fine after dinner speaker at supporters&#39; functions.<br><br>Bertie Auld certainly qualifies as a Celtic Legend.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table> <h3>  </h3><h3> SAME AULD Celtic legend Bertie Auld takes swipe at Rangers idol Graeme Souness for saying Light Blues win would be &lsquo;good for Scottish football&rsquo;</h3>The Lisbon Lion, 79, reckons former Ibrox boss Souey was just jealous of Celtic&rsquo;s success with his comments<br><div class="spoiler_toggle">Spoiler: click to toggle</div><div>By Alex Gordon <br><br>BERTIE AULD claims Graeme Souness was talking nonsense by claiming an Old Firm win for Rangers on Sunday would be good for Scottish football.<br>The Lisbon Lion, 79, reckons former Ibrox boss Souey was just jealous of Celtic&rsquo;s success with his comments &mdash; and insists his old club will do their talking on the pitch.<br><br>Auld said: &ldquo;Why would a victory for them give our football a boost?<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious Souness doesn&rsquo;t like the fact Celtic are dominating the Scottish game at the moment.

That tally included FIVE in what was Jock Stein&rsquo;s first game in charge as manager, and a double in the 1965 Scottish Cup final, helping to deliver the first piece of silverware in what was a golden era for the club.<br><br>Two years later, he was part of the legendary Celtic side that defeated Inter Milan 2-1 on May 25, 1967 in Lisbon&rsquo;s Estadio Nacional to lift the European Cup.<br><br>Bertie played alongside the late, great Bobby Murdoch in the heart of the Celtic team, and it was the most formidable midfield duo in football at that time.<br><br>And today, March 23, as Bertie celebrates his birthday, we bring you a previous interview that the Celtic View had the pleasure of conducting with one of our greatest ever players.<br>picture<br><br>ONE of the most exciting days of my life and my earliest Celtic memory was the day I first signed for the club. <br>I had never seen inside Celtic Park and if you can picture it, it was completely empty. It was around 11 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and I was there with my Dad, Mr Jimmy McGrory and the secretary of my old club, Maryhill Park. There were empty bottles and rubbish lying on the terraces, left over from the game on the Saturday and looking around the stands, I was just trying to imagine what the place would look like full and I just couldn&rsquo;t. It was the first time that I saw The Jungle, the first time that I had walked down that dark, narrow tunnel out onto the pitch. As a 16-year-old who had been playing Junior football, it was awesome.<br><br>SOME people might say that the highlight of my Celtic career was the 1967 season, but I always look back to when I returned here from Birmingham in &lsquo;65. <br>I had always believed that I would come back and all of a sudden I arrived on a Monday morning, to meet Jimmy McGrory again and also Tommy Riley and Sean Fallon. I flew up that morning with my wife and my daughter and dropped them off in Knightswood at my mother-in-law&rsquo;s. I then went to Celtic Park, put on one of the old grey training tops, a pair of sandshoes, shorts and socks and went out and loosened up. Jimmy then came out with Sean and Tommy and everything just fell into place. Even just putting on the training gear that day and going out for a run, I felt that I had &lsquo;arrived&rsquo;. There might have been ups and downs, but from that day on things just seemed to click into place.<br><br>THERE were disappointments in my first spell at the club and before I joined Birmingham I had the opportunity to go to Everton in a double transfer with Bobby Collins. <br>Then, after that, the board tried to transfer me to Blackpool and there was no way I was going to entertain anything like that. I had worked hard to get to Celtic. My Dad had made a lot of great decisions and knew that the time was right for me to join the club as a 16-year-old. He believed I had an opportunity and he was right, it was a fantastic opportunity. Unfortunately, at that time, you didn&rsquo;t get picked on your ability; it was down to whether or not the chairman, Robert Kelly, liked you. On the day that big Jock and his Dunfermline team beat us in the 1961 Scottish Cup final, I was playing up at Tannadice in a reserve game. That season was a real low for me and when Birmingham came in for me after that game, they got me at the right time. And I couldn&rsquo;t have picked a better club to go to.<br><br>THERE were two or three grounds that I loved to play at, apart from Celtic Park and one was Cathkin, Third Lanark&rsquo;s ground. <br>That&rsquo;s all closed up now, but that was a great place to play, because they always had a team who would try to play football against you and would lift their game. Dens Park in Dundee was another magnificent ground, as was Tynecastle in Edinburgh. Those games always felt like cup finals and there was no love lost in any of the games we played. They were always end to end, with no tackles pulled. Kilmarnock games were a bit like that as well and Rugby Park was another great place to play. But the quality of player during that era of Scottish football was outstanding, there was an abundance of talent. It was an era where people came in their droves to watch the games and it was a fabulous time to play in.<br>picture2<br><br>THERE was one player who never gave me a kick of the ball and I must have played against him round about half a dozen times. Albert Murphy was definitely my toughest opponent. <br>​He was an Irishman who played for Clyde and what a player he was, he was long before his time and was like Danny McGrain - with a bit more height. He was a magnificent player. He went back to Ireland when he finished playing and had so much passion, so much ability and charisma, but was not egotistical. He was certainly the best full back I ever played against.<br><br>IT wasn&rsquo;t until Celtic took us all back to the Estadio National in 2007 for the game against Benfica that I really started to remember the build-up to the European Cup final. <br>Standing in the tunnel, the memories just started to flood back. I could remember sitting in this big, dark dressing room, with the noise and excitement all around me. The ones who looked the least excited were the ones who were going to play, they all had this calmness about them. Then we walked out into the tunnel, 30 yards up to the steps leading out to the pitch and they then kept us there until everything was ready. I can remember wee Jimmy looking them up and down and talking about the size they were. Now when we were at home, on the bus going to games, we used to sing Celtic songs and that&rsquo;s what came to me that night. It was second nature and I we just started to sing the &lsquo;Celtic Song&rsquo;. We started in a quiet, low, deep voice and then, by the final verse, Pavarotti would have been proud of us!<br><br>THERE were two great rewards that I have enjoyed from being a part of that Celtic team, the first is the closeness we have and we are such great friends. <br>The second thing is actually something that my Dad said would happen when I signed in 1955 and he told me that if I did well, then I would become a part of that Celtic support. The people who gathered every week to watch us on the terraces, they were a part of us, as much as we were a part of them. That&rsquo;s why I have always said that we are &lsquo;a family&rsquo;. The Celtic supporters were fantastic, they came to us when we were in need and supported us at all times and we will always appreciate that.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table> <h3><br>  </h3><div><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table> <h3>  </h3> </div><div></div><div></div><div><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table> <h3>  </h3> </div><div></div> </div><div></div>
