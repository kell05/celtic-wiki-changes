Eddie wanted to form the new group because at that time </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3">supporters clubs could not gain membership of the Celtic Supporters Association and as a consequence were finding it difficult to get their hands on tickets for the increasing number of all ticket matches the club were involved in.</font> <br><br><font color="#008000" face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000">Eddie wrote a letter to the Celtic View outlining his </font></font><font color="#008000" face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000">proposals and the response was was overwhelming.</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3"> At the first meeting of the as yet unnamed affiliation held at The Broomfield Tavern in Provanmill </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3">300 supporters turned up, as did the then Celtic directors Jack McGinn and Tom Grant. </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3">With approval of the Celtic board a constitution was drawn up and a committee elected and the Affiliation of Registered Celtic Supporters Clubs was given the official seal of approval. </font><br><br><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3">Since then the affiliation has grown significantly with member clubs across the UK and Ireland as well as Canada and the USA. The affiliation has organised an annual five-a-side competition and stages a wide range of social and charitable events.</font>
