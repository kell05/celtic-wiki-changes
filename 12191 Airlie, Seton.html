He used to come down every training night and to talk to the lads and talk over the previous Saturday&#39;s game.&quot;He was fabulous. I am very, very proud to have known him.&quot;His involvement curtailed as he matured in years but he was always there, always had a laugh and a joke with the boys, he was full of stories about his playing days in the Army.<br><br>&quot;He was a dear, sweet man. The boys all liked him.&quot; Graham Selby, who played for City 300 times before becoming scout until two season ago, said: &quot;I never saw him as a player but as a person he was a great character and he always had a story to tell. He was a fantastic personality and he will be sadly missed.&quot;He went to play football for Cannes after the war and he was telling us that there was an avenue of bungalows down by the beach and he was in with all these celebrities.&quot;Pablo Picasso was in the same avenue as these bungalows.&quot; <br><br>City chairman Dave Boddy added: &quot;It&#39;s terribly sad news to hear of Jock&#39;s death.<br><br>&quot;He was a remarkable and much-loved character by many generations of people passing through St George&#39;s Lane.&quot;His involvement with the club stems back to the 60s and his contribution to the club, mainly in a scouting capacity, was vastly appreciated and he played a large part in helping to bring many excellent players to the Lane down the years.<br><br>The funeral service will take place at Worcester Crematorium on Wednesday at 11am</font><font face="Arial, sans-serif"> <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></font>  </div></div><br>
