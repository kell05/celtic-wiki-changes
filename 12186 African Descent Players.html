It    underpins the ethos of the club but also emphasises important points,    which, in reflection of the social history &amp; background that Celtic   has had to  challenge in Scotland, is an important point. <br><br>As  the  Irish-Catholic community has  built and integrated in Scotland,  there  have been waves of other cultures that have  grown in Scotland,  such as  the Asian communities (Pakistani &amp; Indian in particular)  and  increasingly since the early 2000s the Eastern European &amp; Black   African communities. <br><br>In January 2018, Celtic  defeated Hearts   3-1 in  another match that pushed Celtic to the domestic  treble. The   three  scorers were Edouard, Dembele and Ntcham. All three  were of   African  descent (albeit now playing for European national  sides), and   of differing religious beliefs, and no one batted an  eyelid at Celtic.   The three were highly regarded, and  were key players  in the first   team. <br><br> It clearly showed the full integration and  acceptance   regardless of colour, race,  religion etc, and that was a   clear   evolution of the game in Scotland.</div><div><br>One of  the significant   aspects of this moment was that of the demographic  change in football   that had been going on over recent generations in  football, and  Celtic  were a proud part of this. Not by any means the  first black  footballers  at Celtic, yet in its own way this match  reinforced to all  the ascent  of the African footballers, who in the past  were often  patronised or  derided in footballing circles.</div><div><br>The below  is  not an exhaustive list but is a snapshot timeline of the progress of   African descent players to have played at Celtic from the early days   where it was possibly initially a novelty for some supporters on the   terraces to then being an established &amp; respected part of the whole   squad.<h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3><h3>Notable Points &amp; Landmarks in Chronological Order<br></h3><h3>1) 1898: John Walker of Hearts<br></h3>In   December 1898, Celtic played Hearts in the League and won 4-3. One of  the Hearts players was John Walker who is likely the first non-white  player  to have ever played in a Celtic First Team game (for or against  Celtic). He  was born in Leith, and was of West Indian descent. He sadly  died  prematurely only two years later.<br><ul><li><a href="/page/1898-12-17%3A+Celtic+3-2+Heart+of+Midlothian%2C+League+Division+1" target="_self">1898-12-17: Celtic 3-2 Heart of Midlothian, League</a></li></ul><i>Note:   It&#39;s possible that (mixed race) Billy Clarke played v  Celtic which  could pre-date John Walker but as of time of writing not yet found.<br></i></div><div><i>Billy Clarke had played for Benburb		 	Crown Athletic		 	Third Lanark		 	Arthurlie		 	East Stirlingshire		 	</i><br><br><h3>2) 1899: &#39;The Kaffirs&#39; tour of the UK from South Africa <br></h3>The  first football team consisting of all &#39;non-white&#39; players to have  played at Celtic Park  were the touring South African team self-dubbed &#39;<i>The Kaffirs</i>&#39;   who played a  series of friendly matches across the UK. Mostly played   as a friendly  tour match as can be seen by some Celtic players playing   in different  positions to their norm.</div><div><ul><li><a href="/page/1899-09-21%3A+Celtic+2-0+The+Kaffirs%2C+Friendly" target="_self">1899-09-21: Celtic 2-0 The Kaffirs, Friendly</a></li></ul></div><div><h3><br>3) 1951-52: Giles Heron</h3></div><div>Despite   the progress in the early days in football, there was actually little   to no further progress for many years throughout football in the UK. It   wasn&#39;t until Gil Heron arrived at Celtic from the US &amp;   Caribbean  that Celtic had a regular starting player of Black African  descent. He  may have only stayed at Celtic for a short time but his  impact was  great, and has been proudly recalled over successive   generations by  the Celtic support. His son was the legendary Gil Scott  Heron who was  to become seminal in the development of various genres of black  music  (including hip hop and rap).</div><div><ul><li><a href="/page/Heron%2CGil" target="_self">Giles Heron</a><br></li></ul></div><div><h3><br>4) 1965: Brazilian Trialists</h3></div><div>There   were  black Brazilian players who arrived at Celtic in the 1960s as    trialists but  they didn&#39;t make it to the first team, if they had then   it  would have been  quite an interesting experience for all of UK   football,  who then had few  if any black footballers playing across the   clubs in  the country.</div><div><ul><li><a href="/page/Trialists" target="_self" title="Trialists">Trialists</a><br></li></ul></div><div><br><h3>5) 1967-78: Paul Wilson</h3>Paul  Wilson is not black or African, but is included here as he was a  non-white player in a long era when non-white players were rare across  all of football in the UK, and his time at Celtic is a major point in  the evolution of non-white players at Celtic, and helped pave the way  for others much later. Disgustingly, opposition fans used to call him  &#39;Sabbu&#39;, a derogatory name against Black people which is best left for  discussion elsewhere on a more appropriate website.</div><div><br>He was  a homegrown success, playing for Celtic  during the 1970s and was given   the full support of the club management  and support despite the   relentless abuse from the opposition terraces.  Society and football had   to change, but at Celtic it was the case that  people were accepted   regardless of their background. Incredibly he is the only non-white  player to have played for Scotland in the entirety of the twentieth  century.</div><div><ul><li><a href="/page/Wilson%2C+Paul" target="_self">Paul Wilson</a><br></li></ul></div><div><br><h3>6) 1988: Mark Walters of Rangers<br></h3>There    is no denying that at Celtic it has not all been plain sailing. Mark    Walters of Rangers when he signed for their club was sadly &amp;   disgustingly harassed  with racist abuse at his first match v Celtic,   with a few sick minded  people on the Celtic terraces throwing bananas   towards him and one or  two even in monkey suits. They were a minority   and not reflective of the Celtic  support in general but their behaviour   was still unacceptable, and counter to the Celtic  ethos. We cannot   accept any abuse against any minorities. <br><br>The forefathers of the  club  were  discriminated and oppressed, and the club was at inception  set up  to help  the downtrodden in the Catholic communities in  Scotland, an  ethic at the club that expanded beyond the Irish-descent  communities. <br><br>Racism  and discrimination against any  group of  people (regardless of where  they are from or what is their skin colour  or creed) is NOT the Celtic  Way or acceptable.</div><div><ul><li><a href="/page/1988-01-02%3A+Celtic+2-0+Rangers%2C+Premier+League" target="_self">1988-01-02: Celtic 2-0 Rangers, Premier League</a></li></ul></div><div><h3><br>7) 1989-91: Paul Elliott</h3>The    arrival of Paul Elliott, and the cult following he created at Celtic,    helped to progress opinions and it was needed to help tackle any   lingering  racism amongst the most difficult stubborn minority. Maybe if   the celebrated Paul McGrath  (a Black Irish international &amp; Man U   player) had come to Celtic  earlier then it would have helped begin the   process sooner than it did.</div><div><br>The  response from the  general  support was positive, and unlike at most  other clubs across  the UK,  there was swift action to tackle the racism issue (both by the  club and  the support in general), which  showed a positive progressive  attitude  and was a success. It should not  mask what had occurred on  occasions in  the past but at least there was honesty. The Celtic  support is a   cross-section of society, so sadly there have been a  minority who have   harboured bigoted views, but the Celtic support do  not tolerate it, and  any bigoted supporters are unwelcome and should be  moved on.</div><div><ul><li><a href="/page/Elliott%2C+Paul" target="_self">Paul Elliott<br></a><br></li></ul></div><div></div><div><h3>8) Jimmy Bone &amp; Power Dynamos FC (of Zambia)</h3></div><div>On a sidenote, ex-Celt Jimmy Bone has a great claim to fame. Probably his greatest achievement was in Zambia with Power Dynamos FC, managing the side to become the first team from southern Africa to win the [African] Cup Winners Cup, the first continental cup won by a southern African side. A wonderful achievement, and a great connection for Celtic with Africa and the development &amp; growth of football. He had a strange recollection of the success:<br><blockquote><i>Interviewer: &quot;Bone masterminded victory in the African Cup Winners&rsquo; Cup &ndash; is there  anything from that experience that might prove useful in the match?&quot;  <br>Jimmy Bone: &ldquo;What, like black magic, you mean? There was a lot of it. Animals  sacrificed and secret potions sprinkled in your socks for good luck, but  if you found chicken-**** in your goalmouth that was bad luck. Before  the final I told my players: &lsquo;Dinnae bother about any of that. Today  you&rsquo;re Scottish.&rsquo; I was the only white guy in the stadium, but I made  them sing Flower of Scotland with me. It did the trick.&rdquo;<br></i></blockquote>      </div><div><ul><li><a href="/page/Bone%2C+Jimmy" target="_self">Jimmy Bone</a><br></li></ul></div><div><br><h3>9) 1999-2000: John Barnes - First Black Manager of a premier club in Scotland <br></h3></div><div>As    a measure of the club&#39;s inclusiveness, Celtic were proud to appoint    John Barnes as one of the first black football managers of one of the   premier/major  clubs anywhere in Europe (in his case of Afro-Caribbean   descent). That was a  major achievement. He may have not have gone on to   be a success as a manager but that was  due to his own inability.   Regardless, he was supported heavily by the Celtic board &amp; support   till it  all dramatically unravelled. In any moments of clarity, he will   have to clearly  admit that Celtic were fully supportive, but sadly he   has been publicly very  vocal in his arrogance &amp; delusions about  his  own record at Celtic &amp; elsewhere.</div><div><ul><li><a href="/page/Barnes%2C+John" target="_self">John Barnes</a><br></li></ul></div><h3><br></h3><h3>10) 1997-2004: Henrik Larsson - Celtic&#39;s Legendary player<br></h3><div>You    can&#39;t talk about the impact that black players have had without    mentioning Henrik Larsson. He is of mixed race, and was taken to the    hearts of all the support, and he openly states his love for the club    &amp; supporters at every opportunity. It was a measure of the Willie    Maley quote of the acceptance and love for Larsson.</div><div><ul><li><a href="/page/Larsson%2C+Henrik" target="_self">Henrik Larsson</a><br></li></ul></div><div><h3><br></h3><div><h3>11) 2018: Three Scorers: Celtic 3-1 Hearts, Jan 2018</h3></div>In   January 2018, Celtic  defeated Hearts 3-1 in  another match that    pushed Celtic to the domestic  treble. The three  scorers were Edouard,    Dembele and Ntcham. All three  were of African  descent (albeit now    playing for European national  sides), and of differing religious    beliefs, and no one batted an  eyelid at Celtic. The three were highly    regarded, and  were key players  in the first team. In some ways this   moment sealed the transition over the past few generations.</div><div><ul><li><a href="/page/2018-01-30%3A+Celtic+3-1+Hearts%2C+SP" target="_self">2018-01-30: Celtic 3-1 Hearts, League</a></li></ul><h3><br></h3><h3>12) 2010s - Celtic youth players<br></h3>One  of the next stages would be for a player from the growing population of  Black African descent people in Scotland to make the step up.  Scottish-Somalian <a href="/page/Feruz%2C+Islam" target="_self">Islam Feruz</a>  could have been the first player but he bunked off to Chelsea too early  before even his first competitive match for Celtic; his career  collapsed for many reasons. <br><br>The first to play in a competitive match was the young <a href="/page/Dembele%2C+Karamoko" target="_self">Karamoko Dembele</a>, of whom [at time of writing] much is hoped for the future.</div><div>[... to add further notes ....]<br><h3><br>13) The Future?</h3></div><div>The    future has already come. The first Celtic side was all Catholic and  of  Scottish &amp; Irish descent,  and it is highly celebrated that the   Lisbon Lions 1967 European Cup  winning side was all from the West of   Scotland (a mixture of Catholics  &amp; Protestants). Those homegrown   days are likely all gone.  All future sides will be cosmopolitan in   their construction, and will  encompass various people of differing   nationalities, birthplaces, racial colours (mixed or not) and    religions, and it will be as much to celebrate as that of the teams  of   our forefathers. <br><br>The rise of the African descent players and   their  successful integration into our club is another matter to be   proud of.  Only time will now tell how football will further evolve, but   it will hopefully continue to be in a positive  direction whatever  happens.</div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br><img align="bottom" alt="African Descent Players - The Celtic Wiki" height="393" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/777a0ca5cdf6334c518e32a22e7f17d0/GW668H393" title="African Descent Players - The Celtic Wiki" width="668"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="African Descent Players - The Celtic Wiki" height="597" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/35e2f91e3144166a6c2a296de5c13c35/GW680H597" title="African Descent Players - The Celtic Wiki" width="680"><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3><h3>Links</h3><ul><li>Notable Matches:</li><ul><li><a href="/page/2018-01-30%3A+Celtic+3-1+Hearts%2C+SP" target="_self">2018-01-30: Celtic 3-1 Heart of Midlothian, League</a></li><li><a href="/page/1988-01-02%3A+Celtic+2-0+Rangers%2C+Premier+League" target="_self">1988-01-02: Celtic 2-0 Rangers, Premier League</a></li><li><a href="/page/1951-08-18%3A+Celtic+2-0+Morton%2C+League+Cup" target="_self">1951-08-18: Celtic 2-0 Morton, League Cup</a><br></li><li><a href="/page/1899-09-21%3A+Celtic+2-0+The+Kaffirs%2C+Friendly" target="_self">1899-09-21: Celtic 2-0 The Kaffirs, Friendly</a></li><li><a href="/page/1898-12-17%3A+Celtic+3-2+Heart+of+Midlothian%2C+League+Division+1" target="_self">1898-12-17: Celtic 3-2 Heart of Midlothian, League</a><br></li></ul></ul><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3></div><br><br>
