Playing in the rankings behind Craig  Gordon, who had just had a phenomenal season with Celtic, meant that  Logan was going to have to bide his time. <br><br>However, he was to be  little used, and as Deila&#39;s reign as manager collapsed in 2015/16,  Bailly was little preferred to be used even in matches against lowly rated opponents (e.g.  against Stranraer and East Kilbride in the Scottish Cup).<br></font><br>A  poor performance in the 2015-16 end of season loss to St Johnstone  didn&#39;t help Ronny Deila&#39;s stats in his final run of games to his departure, and it formed supporters doubts over Bailly&#39;s long-term opportunities. In his  only three league appearances, Celtic had conceded a goal in each, but in  fairness the whole team at that time wasn&#39;t doing too well. Morale was low and the defence out of sorts.<br><br>Worse for him was that when Craig Gordon the next season was off form, rather than  use Bailly, new manager Rodgers brought in De Vries. Shame for Bailly,  as practically all else were given opportunities to reboot their  careers, but not in his case.   Even when De Vries soon lost form, the  manager reverted to Gordon, so Bailly was never given a look-in. <br><br>He  was getting little chance to play a part in Celtic&#39;s incredible  return to form in season 2016-17 under Rodgers, and Bailly was being  long-forgotten. He played only a single game, once in the league coming on late as a sub, in that incredible season as Celtic went on to seal the domestic treble undefeated. It was an easy 5-0 victory over Hearts, so there was little for him to do or prove.<br><br>The coaching staff had tried to help him out, but Logan Bailly refused to go on loan for a month to Raith Rovers towards the end of the 2015-16 season. Even though assistant manager John Collins tried hard to get Bailly to help out former Celt John Hughes, Bailly refused to play at what he thought was a low level club.<br><br>Bailly was released by Celtic in July 2017. Celtic had an option to keep the player for another year but decided against it with some putting it down to allegations that Bailly cared more for the Glasgow nightlife than actually trying to get himself in to the first team.<br><br>He left Celtic returning to Mouscron in his native Belgium in a bid to get his career back on track.<font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font><br><br>We wish him the best.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Quotes</h3>&ldquo;Under normal circumstances I&rsquo;d have been a first-team regular with Celtic. But I got injured two days before our first Champions League qualifier (in season 2016/17). Another keeper [De Vries] came along to take my place. Our results were always up to standard, so there was no need to change the team. But my two seasons at the club were pure pleasure. Celtic are the best team I have played for. We won lots of trophies during my time with them. We set new points and goalscoring records for the Scottish League.&rdquo;<b><font face="Calibri"><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" size="3"><br>Logan Bailly (July 2017)</font></font></font></b><b>  </b><b>  </b><b>  </b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Playing Career<font color="#333333"><br></font></h3><div align="center"><div align="left"><font color="#333333"><i><b>  </b></i></font></div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td align="left" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">SCOTTISH CUP</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">LEAGUE CUP</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">EUROPE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">TOTAL</font></b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td align="left" width="16%"><b>2015-16</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">3</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">2</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" width="16%"><font color="#333333">Shut-outs</font></td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">2</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" width="16%"><b>2016-17</b></td><td align="center" width="16%">1</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">1</td></tr><tr><td width="16%">Shut-outs</td><td align="center" width="16%">1</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">1</td></tr><tr><td width="16%"><b>Total</b></td><td align="center" width="16%"><b>4</b></td><td align="center" width="16%"><b>2</b></td><td align="center" width="16%"><b>0</b></td><td align="center" width="16%"><b>0</b></td><td align="center" width="16%"><b>6</b></td></tr><tr><td align="left" width="16%"><b><font color="#333333">Shut-outs</font></b></td><td align="center" width="16%"><b>1</b></td><td align="center" width="16%"><b>2</b></td><td align="center" width="16%"><b>0</b></td><td align="center" width="16%"><b>0</b></td><td align="center" width="16%"><b>3</b></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>  Honours with Celtic<br></h3><font color="#333333"><b>Scottish League</b><br></font><ul><li><font color="#333333"><a href="/page/2016" target="_self" title="2015-16"><font size="2">2015-16</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="/page/2017" target="_self" title="2016-17"><font size="2">2016-17</font></a></font><br></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Pictures</h3>  <ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/Bailly%2C+Logan+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul><h3>KDS</h3><ul><li><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/9243919/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="KDS Forum">KDS Forum (2015)</a></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Logan Bailly: Celtic sign Belgian goalkeeper</h3><font color="#333333">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33449946</font><br><br><font color="#333333">Celtic have signed Belgian goalkeeper Logan Bailly on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.</font><br><br><font color="#333333">The 29-year-old arrives from OH Leuven having previously played for Borussia Monchengladbach and Genk.</font><br><br><font color="#333333">He will provide cover for Craig Gordon following the summer departure of former deputy Lukasz Zaluska.</font><br><br><font color="#333333">&quot;I think I&#39;m in my prime as 29 or 30 years old is a great age for a goalkeeper,&quot; Bailly told the Scottish champions&#39; website. </font><br><br><font color="#333333">&quot;It&#39;s a great feeling, it&#39;s big team with a big history and I&#39;m very happy I&#39;m here.

When I came back from Germany, I went to Switzerland and then home to Belgium.<br><br>&ldquo;I was there for three years and every day I woke up and went to training with hope.<br><br>&ldquo;Now I have signed for Celtic, I wake up every day and see the chance I have to be part of this club.<br><br>&ldquo;Before I joined Celtic, I heard a lot about it &mdash; about the fans, the team and the history.<br><br>&ldquo;Now I am inside, I see what it&rsquo;s like and why everybody knows Celtic.

He is a guy with a lot of experience.<br><br>&ldquo;Craig has had a fantastic career and I can learn from him every day on the training pitch.<br><br>&ldquo;I only knew Craig from the TV before, but I am getting to see him every day now and I learn more about him.<br><br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a great guy, a very simple guy like any other keeper, and we have a good partnership together. It&rsquo;s great to train with Craig and the coach.<br><br>&ldquo;Do I still want his jersey? Yes. Goalkeeper is a different position to any other. There is only one of you who can play. You have to respect each other and I have a good feeling about training with Craig and the coach.<br><br>&ldquo;We are like a small family because we are training all the time together and we give each other confidence. But any keeper would learn from Craig. He&rsquo;s a great player and a great guy.&rdquo;<br><br>Long term, Bailly also has unfinished business at international level &mdash; but he won&rsquo;t make any grand statements.<br><br>Thibaut Courtois and Simon Mignolet have emerged during his absence and the new Bhoy is happy to stay patient and focus on his club form.<br><br>Bailly said: &ldquo;My first job is to learn with Celtic, try to play some games, and win something with the club.<br><br>&ldquo;That is the most important thing. I didn&rsquo;t sign here and think &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in the national squad within six months&rsquo;.<br><br>&ldquo;Celtic is the most important thing for me and that is what I will focus on.&rdquo;<br><br>Barring one dodgy moment, Bailly looked the part against Eibar in Spain&rsquo;s Basque region on Saturday night.<br><br>Leigh Griffiths won the man of the match award after bagging a hat-trick, but the Belgian keeper was an assured presence for Celtic.<br><br>Gordon will doubtless return for the Champions League qualifier against Stjarnan on Wednesday, yet Bailly will continue to push him.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;For a goalkeeper, it is always great to stop a penalty. That was my first game so it was a nice feeling.<br><br>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not the most important thing for me &mdash; it was that we had a good game.<br><br>&ldquo;However, saving the penalty will give me confidence, for sure.<br><br>&ldquo;When you play with a good team, that&rsquo;s what you get. I am feeling more and more confident with Celtic now.<br><br>&ldquo;It was very nice to start my career with Celtic.
