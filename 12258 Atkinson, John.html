In 97 league matches, Atkinson scored 27 goals. <br><br>He made one appearance for Celtic on 22 April 1909, and scored two goals as Celtic thrashed Morton 5-1. It was a kind gesture by Accies to loan him to Celtic, as the usual Celtic outside-left, David Hamilton, had been injured in the match between the two sides the previous day. Celtic had a fixture backlog and play eight times in 11 days! <br><br>Partick Thistle took him for a month or so in March 1910, and thereafter he qualified as a Doctor and practiced in County Durham until the outbreak of war. He then travelled abroad, working in Madagascar. Tragically on 26 November 1914, at the age of 29, he drowned in an accident off the west coast of Africa.</div><div></div><div></div><img align="bottom" alt="[Untitled]" height="136" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/0653f4d9dd8abfcc15005f9bc1c2586b/GW585H136" title="[Untitled]" width="585"><br><br>Thx to @stuthejag for the below.<br><img align="bottom" alt="Atkinson, John" height="376" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/d5b1dba11a7270a248523450521ff894/GW515H376" title="Atkinson, John" width="515">
