On February 2nd, he signed a 3.5-year deal for a fee believed to be around &pound;1.75m, with some stories that he had actually been angling for a move down south but couldn&#39;t get it. <br><br>Interestingly, he admitted that he had never watched a Celtic v Rangers match in his life. A complete highlander you could say, but stood out due to his wonderful hair as the humourists in the support pointed out.<br><br>Both he &amp; Gary Mackay Stevens hit the ground running scoring a goal etc, and made an instant impact with a win over Partick Thistle, and the joy was their for all to see on their faces. Already many saw someone possibly special.<br> <br> He was to make an even bigger impact in his first game at Celtic Park, scoring and for Celtic within 2 minutes against Inter Milan. Uefa decided this goal v Inter Milan was in the Top 10 Euroleague goals for season 2014/15. Things looked up for him. <br><br> A good physique and bundles of energy, he was being likened to past players like Petrov in the hope he could emulate their success, but that could be an unnecessary burden. Athletic and skillful, he had a good eye for a long pass or a great shot at goal, and was to go onto score various &#39;screamers&#39;. Generally attacking in the centre of midfield, letting Scott Brown dictate and play the defensive side, but though he was a central player for Dundee United, most of his appearances for Celtic were to come from the left-side although he fitted in centrally in the midfield in time. <br> <br> In his first 4 months at Celtic he&#39;s given a few quiet but efficient performances, showing a decent touch and good passing skills, but things though didn&#39;t go to plan the following season. The Ronnie Delia managerial experiment was underfire, and Armstrong was mostly anonymous (scoring in just three games (four goals)), and supporters were already feeling that he&#39;d had an Indian summer and there was little left. In fairness, he wasn&#39;t the only underperformer but Celtic still won the league, but Armstrong was deemed not one for revitalising the side. In truth the sympathisers were in the minority.<br><br>Things turned from once Brendan Rodgers came on board, and the Ronnie Deila experiment was ended. Rodgers arrived and along with many others, Armstrong was given a further chance to prove himself, and Rodgers&#39; touch worked wonders for Armstrong.<br><br><div><b>Brendan Rodgers Era<br></b>Armstrong&#39;s rehabilitation came to the fore as he sealed the victory in the first 5-1 win over Sevco in 2017-18. Thereafter he was a pivotal player as Celtic strove to achieve the impossible with a domestically undefeated season, and duly did so as the InVIncilbles and sealed the treble. Armstrong was a key player that season, working hard in midfield and scoring some exceptional goals. Scoring a further goal v Sevco helped bolster his popularity, but he was performing consistently that season against all comers.</div><br>He took the bull by its horns, and his form was to be exceptional. A strong runner, an eye for a good move albeit can be an erratic passer of the ball, and also a great finisher from long range. He unsettled defences but repeatedly scored great goals from in &amp; outside the box, and was a key player in the midfield.<br> <br> Brendan Rodgers was so impressed he branded Stuart Armstrong as &ldquo;<i>The Blonde Cafu</i>&rdquo; [Cafu was a highly rated Brazililan player] after his Man-of-the-Match performance in 3-0 romp against Inverness in Nov 2016.<br><br>The fans showed their appreciation with a very original song dedicated to him (and his wonderful hair!) based on a OMD song. It was very popular amongst the support, and raised cheers across football. <br><br>It was the season when Armstrong truly did &#39;score belters all the time&#39; as the song went, and he was a key player as Celtic went onto seal the InVIncibles unbeaten domestic run winning the treble.<br><br>An appreciative Stuart Armstrong commented: <br><blockquote><i>&quot;Very lucky to be playing under Brendan. The influence he&#39;s had in such a short space of time is unbelievable.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br> Sevco player (and ex-Celt) player Kenny Miller almost broke Armstrong&#39;s ankles in a two footed challenge near the start of a match v Sevco, which incredibly didn&#39;t earn Miller a red card. If Armstrong needed an understanding of Celtic v Sevco games, then that was there for him to experience it.<br> <br> Armstrong you could see was very happy and you could see his development with many pinning hopes that we could build a midfield around him for years. After all the promise it was great to see his push forward.<br> <br> If there was a negative, then in matches v European opposition a repeat complaint was that he struggled to find his feet, and most often was anonymous. Granted that often the entire Celtic side were poor in European games against higher rated sides, but Armstrong was part of the problem here and not the solution. A lot of work was required on this front.<br><br>As a crude measure of his success, whilst he was pushing forward, his colleague Gary Mackay Stevens was transferred out despite further opportunities. Both started similarly but then it all diverged from there.<br><br>Things turned from the end of season 2017-18. Expectations of a renewed contract turned into a surprising short single season extension which surprised many people. Showed a certain lack of long-term commitment to Celtic, and the mood against the former favourite soured. Possibly he was possibly being arrogant to believe that he was ready to move on to a higher stage, but on the other hand he could have run down his contract and Celtic would have lost out. His form began to slump and it was a mystery, and unnecessarily the critics were out in force. He needed to once again reboot his career at Celtic. <br><br> Cynics would say that his lack of commitment to Celtic after a great 2016-17 season was partly attributable to his downturn in form in 2017-18, where he scored a paltry 4 goals and was out for around three months with an injury. His lack of form was noticeable as Celtic scored fewer goals from long-range, and his incisiveness was missed. If anything both sides were missing out. Celtic still went on to win the treble and make history in the back-to-back trebles (first ever), but Armstrong was not as dynamic or as crucial as before.<br> <br> On the other hand, there were a number of key players at Celtic who were underperforming, with Scott Brown&#39;s excellent form covering for the others, so it wasn&#39;t just Armstrong. As the season went on, players like Ntcham were finally finding their feet and with Rogic returning after injury in the season, Armstrong could no longer count on being a certain starter. The developing emergence of Callum McGregor also added competition. If anything, there was a welcome surplus to the quality in the midfield but for the incumbent midfielders it could be a frustration if they were out the side.<br> <br> With respect to the inconsistency, some might attribute that Armstrong (to his credit) was studying for a law degree on the Open University in parallel to playing football for Celtic. When any player does that then their concentration is divided, but for his own personal benefit it is a credible project. Only he can answer if that contributed to the lulls in his time at Celtic, but no denying when on form he was excellent on the park.<br><br><b>Departure from Celtic</b><br> In June 2018, to the surprise of many, Armstrong accepted a transfer to Southampton (a club that was very much favouring buying up top talent from Celtic, e.g. van Dijk, Wanyama, Forester). Many believed he was going to sign an extension at Celtic to reboot his Celtic career, but if his commitment was questioned and he was possibly concerned about his chances of a starting spot in the seasons to come, then maybe the move was for the best. <br><br>Some humorously quipped that the bulk of the &pound;7m+ transfer fee was for rights for the Armstrong song. In return Southampton in good humour made a charity donation to the Celtic Foundation charity fund for the &#39;rights&#39; to the song which was well received.<br><br> He likely craved for a move down south, he had spent long enough in the Scottish leagues, and after the league titles and back-to-back trebles, with European matches under his belt, he wanted a new challenge. After all the Champions League games and matches in Europe with Celtic against top level competition, he was going to have to learn that the grass isn&#39;t always greener on the other side and playing in the EPL (outwith of the top four) is not that glamorous or a genuine challenge. He hadn&#39;t proven himself enough in Europe. Bar the goal v Inter Milan at the start, since then he hadn&#39;t made a name for himself with his only other European match goal being against Linfield. He still had a lot to prove.<br> <br> It should be remembered that he gave his best despite any questions raised. Always happy and celebrated as much as all when a trophy was won, he seemed very settled at Celtic. He spoke well and was respected in general by the support.<br> <br> He had been at Celtic for 3.5 years, and overall was a very good player, albeit with some inconsistency (i.e. one great season and then some anonymous spells some would argue) but at his best he was an excellent resource. <br> <br> We wish him the best, a fine player who with some further application &amp; experience can build on and gain from it, and his hair should remain mighty fine (the Southampton fans in a social media correspondence even humorously having purchased the song from the Celtic support).<br>  <div><br><b>Post-Celtic</b><br>[....]<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3></div><div><h3>Quotes</h3></div><div>&ldquo;It was very exciting, but I don&rsquo;t think I realised just how big the  club is, what it means to fans, the passion, the noise of the stadium.
