He said: &quot;Last week somebody leaked a story about tampering with brakes, completely unfounded and what does it do?

His close control, manoeuvring of the opposition and footballing cool is  unparalleled at the club. He can go as far as he wants in the game.<br> <br> This shape can lead to some excellent attacking play but continually  leaves us open at the back. Motherwell had 3 attackers lining up  directly against our 3 defenders and could very well have had a couple  of goals out of it. The argument of &quot;but Ajer/Jullien/Brown made a  mistake&quot; isn&#39;t a good one as there will be individual errors in every  match and the formation should give us the best chance of catching these  before they result in a goal.

And a seven-point Premiership lead safelyt intact.<br><br>The Celtic of this year don&rsquo;t just beat whatever is in front of them - they beat them by bagging at least three goals, and by being able to rely upon the predatory instincts of strike pair Odsonne Edouard and Leigh Griffiths.<br><br>The Frenchman&rsquo;s double, and another from the rejuvenated 29-year-old, ensured that between them the pair have now plundered 11 of the 19 goals that Celtic have netted in six straight wins since the winter shutdown they entered on a low following the Old Firm defeat.<br><br>With that reverse their only blemish across their past 16 league games, Lennon&rsquo;s men are gnashing hard on the bit between their teeth.<br><br>For since the Rangers defeat, the heights scaled have so often been about the sublime talents of Edouard. The 22-year-old took his tally for the season to 24, with Griffiths his wingman in making it four goals from six appearances this year.<br><br>There was litttle surprise that Lennon chose to retain his recently favoured 3-5-2 formation.<br><br>The as-you-were approach meant a fifth game in six that Edouard and Griffiths were deployed as the attacking duo.<br><br>Edouard struck for his first after only nine minutes, the home side allowing the forward and Callum McGregor to sprint forward in tandem as if they were jogging round the park.<br><br>The Scotland midfielder fed his team-mate in front of goal, and sloppy defending meant the Frenchman was able to tuck away the follow-up after his initial effort was blocked. His second, to make it 4-0 with 10 minutes of normal time remaining, was another free-kick in the style of his effort in the 4-1 win over Hamilton at the weekend.<br><br>Relatively close in once more, he seemed to defy the laws of physics in contriving to achieve such a parabolic arc to completely dazzle &#39;Well keeper Mark Gillespie.<br><br>With the scoreline at 1-0, Celtic&rsquo;s goal led a charmed life - never more so than when Fraser Forster instinctively flicked away a drive from impressive debutant Rolando Aarons just before the interval.<br><br>Griffiths had his say after 52 minutes, despite having produced one of his more untidy displays of late. A sloppy pass by Oliver Ntcham that resulted in a clearance from Christopher Jullien was picked up by McGregor. He burst down the left wing and when he squared the ball Griffiths, after seeming to get it caught in his feet, dug it out and finished in the corner.<br><br>Motherwell were a beaten team then. Yet, for all that the scoreline might suggest otherwise, they had seriously tested Celtic&rsquo;s back three - which had Jozo Simunovic in place of youngster Stephen Welsh from the weekend win at Hamilton - as no other opponent has been able to do in this past month.<br><br><br>Stephen Robinson&rsquo;s men were unrecognisable from the team that served up such a soulless display in losing at Livingston at the weekend. With Celtic in town, for the opening period at least, the Fir Park men put on the game-face that made the confrontation third versus first.<br><br>The home side had Celtic under pressure from the off in adopting the high risk strategy of pushing their wide men right up the pitch, in the attempt to expoit spaces in behind Celtic&rsquo;s wing-back James Forrest and Greg Taylor. They did so but the large wide open spaces their approach created both was the making of them and the breaking of them.<br><br>It is admirable to see a Scottish team go toe-to-toe with Celtic, but the outcome has an air of inevitability about it because Lennon&rsquo;s side will wear opponents down by dint of their attacking intensity.<br><br>They had a hatful of chances to add to the three second half goals but will lose little sleep over that.<br><br>One man who will slumber soundly is McGregor, for ensuring that the goalscoring wasn&rsquo;t just the Edouard-Griffiths show.<br><br>The Scotland midfielder has returned from the break looking entirely refreshed and his thirst for net-bulging moments has certainly been replenished.<br><br>His third goal of the year - and ninth of the season - was a corker, bringing under control a ball hoisted in from the right with one touch, before smearing a volley into the top corner.  </div><div></div><div></div><div>                  <br><h3>&#39;Ridiculous&#39; - Neil Lennon hits out at SFA charges dished out to Celtic and Hamilton</h3>Ridiculous: Neil Lennon has hut out at the SFA charges<br>Ridiculous: Neil Lennon has hut out at the SFA charges<br>Andrew Smith<br>Email<br>Published: 23:25<br>Updated: 23:28 Wednesday 05 February 2020<br>https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/celtic/ridiculous-neil-lennon-hits-out-at-sfa-charges-dished-out-to-celtic-and-hamilton-1-5086569<br>Neil Lennon rounded on the charges brought by the SFA on Celtic and Hamilton Accies for &ldquo;failing to act in an orderly fashion&rdquo; during the Scottish champions&rsquo; 4-1 in Lanarkshire at the weekend.<br><br>The sanctions relate to referee Nick Walsh being surrounded by players from both sides in the aftermath of Leigh Griffiths appearing to put a foot down on the chest of Sam Wood.<br><br>The flashpoint led to pushing between Griffiths and Alex Gogic, for which both were booked, a judicial panel later clearing the Celtic striker of any offence for the contact with Woods.<br><br>&ldquo;I thought it was ridiculous,&rdquo; said Lennon. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait and see what happens but I didn&rsquo;t think there was anything in it. The media didn&rsquo;t even ask me about it so I&rsquo;m hoping nothing comes of it.<br><br>&ldquo;For me Leigh didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong and there was no malice or intent. If there was I&rsquo;d be the first to say.<br><br>&quot;Pushing him [Gogic] annoyed me so I had a quick chat with him.

Jermaine Hylton had the first real chance, but the winger snatched at it and the ball flew wide.<br><br>Edouard would make the first-half difference. Credit to Griffiths for stealing the ball from Liam Donnelly before feeding McGregor, who combined with Edouard on the edge of the box. The French striker saw his initial shot blocked but it bounced fortuitously back into his path and he fired low past Mark Gillespie to make it 1-0.<br><br>In an open first half, Motherwell responded immediately as Alan Campbell fired wide and winger Rolando Aarons - making his debut on loan from Newcastle - hit the post from a Liam Polworth cross. The lively Aarons would come close again with an angled drive from the edge of the box which Forster did well to divert over the bar.<br><br>So Motherwell with the better of the first-half chances, but Celtic in front and early in the second half it looked like it was game over.<br>Motherwell have gone three consecutive league games without a win for the first time since April 2019<br><br>McGregor did well to hit the bye-line before cutting back for Griffiths right between the sticks five yards from goal. The Scotland international could not miss - Celtic 2-0 in front.<br><br>The attacks suddenly became incessant. First Edouard set up Griffiths for a header which came back off the bar. Then Edouard played it into the path of Olivier Ntcham eight yards out, but the midfielder blazed over when he really should have scored.<br><br>Scott Brown fired in an effort which ricocheted towards goal, eventually into the gloves of Gillespie. Seconds later the ball was heading back toward the goalkeeper, who saved from McGregor. Seconds after that, he had to save again at the feet of Edouard. It was relentless.<br><br>Motherwell resisted until the final quarter hour when they were ripped apart by a goal of real quality from Celtic. James Forrest provided the assist for McGregor, who took a touch which set the ball up perfectly for him to hit a volley from 18 yards into the net.<br><br>The win would become even more emphatic as Edouard fired in a free kick from 20 yards to make it 4-0.<br><br>A tough scoreline on Motherwell who gave plenty to this match, but Celtic were on another level to end up with.<br>Man of the match - Odsonne Edouard<br><br>So many contenders for Celtic but Edouard once again takes the honour.<br><br>His quality shone through as the champions moved up through the gears. At times he was unplayable, setting up countless chances as well as scoring two himself.<br>&#39;We were magnificent&#39; - reaction<br>Motherwell &#39;had plenty of the first half&#39; - Robinson<br><br>Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson: &quot;We had plenty of the match in the first half. To create that many chances against Celtic, you have to take them.<br><br>&quot;If you don&#39;t take your chances then, eventually, they&#39;ll wear you down. And they did - and won comfortably in the end.&quot;<br><br>Celtic manager Neil Lennon: &quot;I enjoyed the second half a lot more than the first half. Motherwell&#39;s set up caused a few problems but we sorted that out at half-time and second half we were magnificent.&quot;<br>  <br><div class="lx-stream gs-u-box-size gs-t-sport lx-lts--robo-text"><div class="lx-stream__feed"><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at   </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Match ends, Motherwell 0, Celtic 4.</div></div></div><div class="gs-o-media__body"><h3 class="lx-stream-post__header-title gel-great-primer-bold">Full Time</h3></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+2&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Second Half ends, Motherwell 0, Celtic 4.</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-advert-container"></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+1&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Foul by Callum McGregor (Celtic).</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+1&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Christy Manzinga (Motherwell) wins a free kick in the attacking half.</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 89&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Attempt missed.
