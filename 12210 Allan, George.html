He made his debut on September 4th in a 4-1 league victory over <a href="/page/Hibernian" target="_self">Hibernian</a> at <a href="/page/Celtic+Park" target="_self">Celtic Park</a>.<br><br>He got his first goals for the club when he struck twice in a 6-1 home triumph over near neighbours Clyde on September 25th,and if Clyde thought they were off the hook, George Allan scored five goals against them in a 9-1 pummelling on Christmas Day (so little festive cheer for the Bully Wee).<br><br>Already a Scotland international (his sole appearance was a 2-1 win over England at Crystal Palace just a few weeks before signing for Celtic), George Allan showed his prowess in front of goals by hitting 16 goals in 19 league &amp; Scottish Cup appearances for Celtic to finish the club&#39;s top scorer that season. He helped Celtic to the club&#39;s fourth league championship in 1898.<br><br>He was described as &quot;<i>a dribbler of versatility</i>&quot;, and combined with his goal scoring ability, it was clear that he was a superb young talent.<br><br>Despite this success, the powerful runner is said to not have enjoyed Celtic&#39;s patient passing game, and after just a year in Glasgow he returned to Merseyside (pictured in his Liverpool kit on the right). Liverpool held his registration and gladly paid &pound;50 to have him back much to Celtic&#39;s loss. <br><br>Interestingly, after his departure that season, Celtic hit a very poor streak in the post-season local Glasgow League competition, losing four games and drawing one out of the next five. So his departure looks to have had an immediate negative effect.<br><br>At Liverpool, he ended up in a comical situation where in one match the opposition goalkeeper (the then famous &#39;<i>Fatty</i>&#39; Foulkes) had got wound up into a fury, then grabbed Allan and turned him upside down. The referee signalled for a penalty to Liverpool which they converted to win 2-1; George Allan had scored the other one.<br><br>Incredibly he still holds a Liverpool record, reaching 20 goals in a season in the fastest number of games for any player in their club&#39;s history.<br><br>Sadly little more than a year after returning to England, George Allan contracted tuberculosis (the &quot;<i>great white plague</i>&quot;) and he died soon after at the family home in Earlsferry in Fife in 1899. He is buried in Linlithgow Cemetery. <br><br>He had died at the young age of 24 years old. With his remarkable record, we can only now imagine what a great talent was lost to the game due to his illness and then premature death. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Playing Career<br></h3><div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  1897-98</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  17</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  2</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  19</td></tr><tr><td width="16%">Goals:</td><td align="center" width="16%">15</td><td align="center" width="16%">1</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">16</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Honours with Celtic<br></h3><div align="center">  </div><b>Scottish League</b><br><ul><li><font size="2"><a href="/page/1898" target="_self">1897-98</a></font></li></ul><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Pictures</h3><ul><li><a href="/page/Allan%2C+George+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pictures</a></li></ul><h3>Links</h3><ul><li><a href="/page/Allan%2C+George+-+Grave+%26+Memorial" target="_self">Grave &amp; Memorial</a></li></ul><div><h3>Forums</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/celtic_graves/allan-george-1897-98-t442.html" target="_self">CGS Forum - George Allan </a></li></ul></div><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><div><img align="bottom" alt="Allan, George - Pic" height="189" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/sk7Ltjh2lpOtsv72zMHbVA22099/GW338H189" title="Allan, George - Pic" width="338"></div><div><i>Below from the excellent https://www.lfchistory.net/ site<br></i></div><br><h3>1) Liverpool Mercury reported his death on 17th of October 1899: </h3><div>&quot;George Allan, Liverpool&#39;s centre forward, died at Elie, Fifeshire, yesterday morning. Allan was discovered and developed by Liverpool Football Club, and played for Scotland vs. England two years ago. He afterwards joined the Celtic for a season, but returned to Liverpool a year ago. He was the pivot in the team which took Liverpool into the semi-final stage of the Association Cup ties and ran up for the League championship. During the summer he was taken seriously ill, and although it was hoped a few weeks ago that he would recover, he has at length succumbed. Allan was a model centre forward, and Liverpool have suffered severly in losing him.&quot; </div><div></div><div><h3 class="headline">2) George Allan &ndash; As a rule he was a scrupulous player</h3>          <div class="article">Copyright - Manchester Courier, 23-10-1899 - Transcribed by Kjell Hanssen (https://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/385)             </div><div class="article">No doubt to many the news of the death of George Allan,  Liverpool&rsquo;s late and great centre forward, came as a surprise. It is  only six months since he was seen in his famous duel with William  Foulkes, the massive Sheffield United goalkeeper, in the historic  replayed semi-final tie at Fallowfield. At the end of the season his  apparently and sturdy frame and constitution betrayed weakness, and  decay supervened with startling rapidity. Tom Watson, the secretary of  the Liverpool F.C., saw him only a fortnight ago, and described the  transformation as truly shocking. He had in the course of a few short  months sunk from a lusty youth to a stooping ecrepid, wizened, and  prematurely old man.<br> <br> Allan joined Liverpool in his nineteeth year, and under the tuition of a  greast master like James Ross he developed into about the best centre  forward of the day, and not very much inferior to John Goodall and Hugh  Campbell when in their prime. He was a wonderfully accurate and forcible  shot. His most dangerous aim was when he almost had his back to the  goal. He would swing with a half-turn and give the ball a mighty crack  with all his weight and force. Few goalkeepers could divine where this  particular shot would drive, and even if they happened by chance to be  in the right spot it was more by good luck than anything else if they  succeeded in stopping it. Allan was only 24 years old. As a rule he was a  scrupulous player, but, like others, he occasionally took the prospects  of defeat with a rather bad grace.</div></div><div></div><img align="bottom" alt="Allan, George - The Celtic Wiki" height="847" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/c164d008a44ed370198dfffa3543108a/GW562H847" title="Allan, George - The Celtic Wiki" width="562"><br><br><h3>  George Allan Memorial Football Festival 2018 in Linlithgow</h3>https://www.linlithgowgazette.co.uk/lifestyle/george-allan-memorial-football-festival-2018-in-linlithgow-1-4746022<br> <br><img align="bottom" alt="Allan, George - The Celtic Wiki" height="349" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/0e4e724575f3e2a2fb63fd09c2ee649b/GW524H349" title="Allan, George - The Celtic Wiki" width="524"><br>In his memory...Brig United players with the George Allan Trophy which they won for a second consecutive year at the memorial football festival in the Linlithgow Bridge player&#39;s name.
