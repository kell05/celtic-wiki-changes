That game - on 25th April 1910 - saw the Celts clinch the title, a then record 6 championships in a row - and Allan was selected as a replacement for the injured <a href="/page/Quinn%2C+Jimmy+%281900-15%29" target="_self">Jimmy Quinn</a>. </div><br><div>He played the final league game of that season - another 0-0, at Dundee - but being well behind the Mighty Quinn for a starting spot, Allan was never to wear the Hoops again in a competitive match.</div><div></div><div><br>His two matches were the final matches of the 1910/11 season, and can be seen as trial matches for him, but it wasn&#39;t to be. Two no score draw games is a disappointment for any centre-forward, but he got to play in a league title winning side and the ultimate winning game (albeit practically all the work had already been done by the time he was in the side). <br><br>Celtic won the league title by just 2pts over Falkirk. If Celtic had lost both of these games, then depending on the outcome of Falkirk&#39;s remaining matches, things could have been very much different, the goal difference was similar and Falkirk actually had a better scoring record.</div><br><div>Loan spells at Airdrie and Vale of Leven followed before being released in the summer of <a href="/page/1913" target="_self">1913</a>.<br><br>He is believed to have died in 1974, aged 83, a long life.</div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career<br></h3>  <div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  1910-11</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  2</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  2</td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  Goals:</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  0</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>  Honours with Celtic<br></h3><b>Scottish <font size="2">League</font>   <br></b>  <ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/1910" target="_self"><font size="2">1909-10</font></a></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Pictures</h3>  <ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/Allan%2C+Thomas+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul><div><h3>Forum</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/celtic_graves/allan-thomas-1910-13-t742.html" target="_self">CGS Forum</a><br></li></ul></div>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Dundee Evening Telegraph</h3>Wednesday 05 January 1910 <br> Suggests Thomas signed from Law Volunteers, rather than Carluke Milton Rovers<br><img align="bottom" alt="Thomas Allan" height="290" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/c1a14689110030005a90de515a32db0e/GW450H290" title="Thomas Allan" width="450"><br>
