A dominant defender of heavyweight proportions, whether at full- or half-back, Barney Battles was totally committed, being both enthusiastic and fearless.<br><br>Although he lacked pace, his excellent anticipation and finely judged interventions more than compensated for this one defect. <br><br>Big Barney Battles made his Celtic debut in a 2-1 away win at Dundee on 10 August <a href="/page/1895" target="_self">1895</a>, and appropriately signed for the Dark Blues after a brief spell with Liverpool in May <a href="/page/1897" target="_self">1897</a>.<br><br>He rejoined the Bhoys in October <a href="/page/1898" target="_self">1898</a>, and so impressed the Scottish selectors with his consistent performances that he starred in all three Home Internationals of 1901. Battles gained League Championship medals with Hearts (1895) and Celtic (1896), and two <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup" target="_self">Scottish Cup</a> winner&rsquo;s badges at <a href="/page/Celtic+Park" target="_self">Parkhead</a> (1899, 1900), and also represented the Scottish League and Glasgow v Sheffield in 1902. <br><br>In 1898, he broke his wrist and yet he still played the next two games, albeit with his arm in splints and held in a sling. After a victory over Rangers in 1898 the papers proclaimed &quot;<i>St Bernard Battles, Patron of Parkhead</i>&quot;. <br><br>Not always an easy character, for example in 1896 he and several Celtic players were on strike over articles by some journalists and he refused to strip for a match until the respective journalists were removed from the Press Box. He lost, and was suspended from play until the end of the season with his wages cut. <br><br>After his return to Celtic in 1898 the support sang:<br><blockquote><i>&quot;Back to the Celtic again</i><br><i>Let us join in the happy refrain</i><br><i>Out with your rattles</i><br><i>For Big Barney Battles</i><br><i>Is back with the Celtic again!&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br>Transferred in the summer of 1904 to <a href="/page/Kilmarnock" target="_self">Kilmarnock</a>, Barney Battles went down with influenza after playing in a League match at Ibrox on 21 January 1905. He felt well enough to watch a Scottish Cup tie against Beith the next week, but the flu developed into pneumonia and he died suddenly at home in Glasgow&rsquo;s Gallowgate on 9 February 1905, at the young age of thirty. <br><br>A cort&egrave;ge of 2000 with another reported 40,000 people lined the route to Dalbeth cemetery to pay tribute to this hugely popular player. He is buried in lair 412, Section 31.<br><br><div>Barney Battles had a wife and young daughters and was probably unaware that his wife was pregnant again. This child, a boy named after Barney Battles, would emulate the father he never knew by growing up to play for Hearts and Scotland. <br><br>In 1966, Barney Junior presented his father&rsquo;s 1895/96 Championship gold medal to Celtic manager Jock Stein.<br><br><i>From the Alphabet of the Celts, p.23: <br></i>Barney Battles junior was born posthumously and himself fathered a son on Feb. 28th 1940.
